PREMIER Soccer League newboys Manica Diamonds have beaten topflight returnees Hwange to the signature of 23-year-old striker Stanley Ngala. The forward, who scored two goals for Bulawayo Chiefs in the second half of the 2018 season, was at the top of Hwange’s shopping list. The coalminers were dealt a double blow as they also lost midfielder Canaan Nkomo, who played a key role in their Premiership return, by inspiring Hwange to the Zifa Southern Region Division One League title. Nkomo has since joined Bulawayo City, who were relegated from the Premiership to the second tier league. Manica Diamonds seem to have used their financial muscle to lure the gangly Ngala. Ngala was announced alongside veteran goalkeeper Tafadzwa Dube, former Dynamos winger Benjamin Marere, ex-Caps United defender Charlton Munzabwa and unheralded Tatenda Chingondi, who was signed from an unnamed Division Two side. “I personally like quality in terms of the players and the game itself. These signings are quality. I know when you bring in such quality players there is pressure. I’m used to pressure and I know I’ll reach my targets,” said Luke Masomere, the Manica Diamonds coach. Ngala, Dube, Munzabwa, Marere and Chingondi join 19 other players that were unveiled last month in Mutare, who include former national team defender Partson Jaure. Ex-Dynamos and Caps United forward Wisdom Mutasa, winger Marshall Mudehwe, who dumped FC Platinum, and right-back Peace Makaha, who was fired by Dynamos for indiscipline last year, are also at Manica Diamonds. The Gem Boys, as Manica Diamonds are affectionately known, also brought on board ex-Harare City utility player Pritchard Mphelele and retained players with Premiership experience, who include goalkeeper Joram Muchambo, Timire Mamvura, Tinashe Chigade and striker Stephen “Dealer” Sibanda. — @ZililoR
