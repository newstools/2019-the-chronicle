The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter SPORTS and Recreation Commission director-general Prince Mupazviriho has summoned the warring Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) led by long serving Letticia Chipandu and the breakaway Rainbow Amateur Netball League (Ranl) in a bid to find a lasting solution. Mupazviriho confirmed that he had summoned the two parties but refused to discuss the finer details. “Thanks to the media that brought to our attention the differences between the parties. I have since called the  parties to a meeting but I cannot discuss the details. We however want to end these differences for the benefit of netball,” said Mupazviriho. Zina and Ranl have been at loggerheads ever since the breakaway Ranl was formed two years ago. Meanwhile, Ranl will this weekend hold its first annual general meeting ahead of the start of the 2019 season. “The AGM is on this weekend at Selbourne Routledge School Hall in Harare,” said Ranl chairperson Melody Garikai.
