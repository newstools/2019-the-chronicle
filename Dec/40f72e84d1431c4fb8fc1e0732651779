The Chronicle Editor — THE Government should direct all pension funds to back pay pensioners who were paid their lump sums in RTGs dollars.  The Insurance and Pensions Commission is dragging its feet in doing this. There are people who worked for over 30 years in one company and had been paying contributions to a pension fund throughout all those years. From February 2009 to February 2019, people were being paid in US dollars and contributions were being paid in US dollars. Pensioners who were paid their lump sums in 2016 bought houses.  I was paid in RTGs and I only bought groceries and I am getting $250 per month.  How do I survive? In October 2019 Mr Josphat Kakwere gave a statement to the Manica Post saying that pension funds were not obliged to pay in USD as it was at par with the USD. If the RTGs dollar is at par with the USD why then are they as pension fund employees giving themselves pay hikes? Why are they giving themselves cost of living adjustments every month?  Why are they having their allowances increased every month? Mr Josphat Kakwere is forgetting that pension contributions are deducted from workers’ salaries.  They are now living in luxury because of people’s hard earned monies. P Magwere, Nkulumane Bulawayo
