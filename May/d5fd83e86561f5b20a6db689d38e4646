He said during the awareness campaigns, a total of 2 073 stakeholders were capacitated in fire management including traditional leaders. Cde Moyo said Umguza district is among those that recorded a significant decline in veld fires. “Umguza district had a significant decline in area burnt where 34 702.2 hectares were lost in 2017 compared to 20 213 in 2018. Smoking and poaching from Umguza Forestry are the major drivers of veld fires,” he said. Cde Moyo said the province has maintained second position nationally for the past four years in terms of hectarage burnt. “It is disheartening to notice that statistics show that our province is on second position after Mashonaland West province. However, the good news is that fire incidences are decreasing,” he said. — @tamary98
