The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A WOMAN from Bulawayo has been sentenced to a wholly suspended six months in prison for stealing five litres of juice and two kilogrammes of kapenta. Precious Moyo (40) of Njube suburb stole from Mr Collen Mapope’s shop which is located along Fife Street in the Central Business District. Moyo pleaded guilty to theft when she appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Nomasiko Ndlovu. The magistrate sentenced her to a wholly suspended six months in prison on condition that she does not commit a similar offence within the next five years. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said on November 20 this year in the morning, Moyo entered Mr Mapope’s shop and pretended to be a customer. “While inside, the accused person took 1 x 5 litres of cool drink and 20 x 100 grammes of kapenta and hid them in a bag,” he said. Moyo then walked out of the shop without paying for the goods she had taken. She was apprehended outside the shop by one of the shop’s employees. Moyo was searched and found with the stolen goods. She failed to account for them and the matter was reported to the police leading to her arrest. All the stolen goods valued at $130 were recovered. In court she apologised for her actions and said she will not steal again.-@zinyuke98
