The Chronicle Editor: What is currently happening in the country is a direct cumulative result of our economic and compliance behaviour shortfalls over several years. l know it’s strange for many to hear this but that’s an emotional response to common sense. Money is not a commodity. Zimbabweans made it one wrongly. A country must have businessmen not dealers who spend nights crafting ways of cheating Government. Do we bank money? In what way do we contribute to State coffers? BEAM school funds come from the State. Social Welfare comes from the State. Bursaries, scholarships, Zimdef etc all become available when businesses and individuals contribute to State funds by doing things legally. Is your rogue company registered? Are you audited? Do you complete activity returns? As long as we citizens do not behave, pay taxes to government and do everything above board we will be shooting ourselves in the foot. How can we worship corruption, praise a 25-year-old boy driving the latest cars, that’s nonsense. We must learn from what currently obtains that one cannot beat State apparatus! In the long-run we cry foul. Self-inflicted. No to corruption in any form. Report any irregularity, improper behaviour, immoral behaviour etc. Worried Nkulumane, Bulaway
