The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE Central Region Division One League matches are heading to week six with table toppers Sheasham looking to step up efforts to win promotion into the Premier League when they play host to Ivan Hoe Mine today. Sheasham roped in former Nichrut coach John Nyikadzino, and have so far recorded four wins having played one less game. Ivan Hoe Mine are on fourth position with eight points; four behind leaders Sheasham. Ivan Hoe’s latest’s encounter saw them putting league debutants Filabusi United to the sword with a 2-0 victory at home. Another league debutant, The Venue, will be travelling to Gweru for a date with league anchors Real BVR FC to seek a second away win. Real BVR FC has so far proved to be having the worst defence, conceding the most goals, 10, while scoring three. The Venue coach Admore Sibanda said his charges will treat their opponents with respect and are going there as underdogs regardless of Real BVR’s position on the table. “It’s a big task ahead of us, on Sunday we’re travelling to Gweru and the players are slowly gaining experience and they now know how to win games in Division One. “In fact, our target is to collect maximum points there and continue believing since the league is a marathon,” said Sibanda.
