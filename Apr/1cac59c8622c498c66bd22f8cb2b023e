The Chronicle Business Reporter A NEW lodge has been opened in Bulawayo after the investors injected an estimated US$70 000 on the project. The property, which is called Cycad Lodge, is located in Morningside, one of the city’s upmarket suburbs. In an interview, one of the directors Mr Nyararai Gomba said they were seeking to provide comfortable hospitality in Bulawayo. “We don’t have the figures offhand but maybe plus or minus US$70 000 has been injected into the property. When we established it, we wanted to create an environment where you feel at home but at the same time enjoying the luxury of being booked in a lodge,” he said. He said the rooms were very modern and up to date with all the technological features that one requires for comfort and communication such as Wi-Fi and air condition. Mr Gomba said their aim was to make guests at the lodge feel at home as well as providing them with a clean and safe environment. “We have in the past had conversations with people in terms of their service delivery and we always engage our customers to have a feeling of what they always feel about the experience which they will have had when they are staying with us. We want to make you feel at home and provide a clean environment,” he said. The lodge has nine rooms, including a cottage for clients that would require accommodation as a family. “Very soon we will be building additional rooms,” said Mr Gomba, adding that they also have another hospitality property, Ivory Guest House, located in the upmarket area of Burnside. He said they have hosted a number of local and international visitors from countries such as South Africa, US and Japan.
