It said it will examine whether the merger will lessen competition in the country or will result in the creation of a monopolistic situation, which is contrary to public interest. The commission said interested stakeholders, including competitors, suppliers and customers should submit their written representations regarding the proposed merger at the Commission’s offices in Harare “no later than 14 June 2019”.
