A SOUTH Africa-based tennis coach, Michael Nkosi, will today hold a one-day coaching session at Emakhandeni Tennis Club to impart tactics and skills on youngsters. The 63-year-old coach, who grew up in Mzilikazi and moved to the neighbouring country in 1974, played during the National Tennis Development (NTD) era in the 1980s. “I’m looking forward to the great day with the kids because my passion is to see Zimbabwean tennis players making it to the international arena. “This kind of imitative will not just benefit me but also the kids who are passionate about tennis and who’re dreaming to represent Zimbabwe,” said Nkosi. He said during the session, he will emphasise on the importance of good health and advise youths to refrain from drug abuse. “I am 63 years but I am still going strong because sports and good health are my first priorities. I want to inspire the kids so that they are aware of the importance of giving their all when it comes to sports,” he said. Nkosi said he is a seasoned development coach and it is his desire to see kids achieve something out of tennis like exposure to better schools through scholarships and bursaries. “Tennis is a sport of kings as we have many people from disadvantaged backgrounds who are travelling all over the world because of tennis, some are doctors, lawyers and so forth through tennis” he said. Nkosi’s initiative come three days after three Namibian-based former Emakhandeni Tennis Club coaches held a one-day free coaching session for young players at the centre. The coaches were Wellington Sibanda, Mkhululi Khuphe and Nqobilizwe Moyo who’re beneficiaries of the NTD which was administered by Larry Kats. – @DecoDecent2
