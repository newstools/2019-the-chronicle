The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief GWERU City Council has embarked on a land audit amid indications that the local authority could have lost millions of dollars in potential revenue through illegal sale of stands, plan approvals and permits. In a notice, Town Clerk Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza said the audit will cover residential, industrial and institutional stands. “Notice to individuals who bought stands in Gweru. City of Gweru is currently undertaking a land audit and is kindly requesting those who bought, industrial (heavy / light / service), commercial, institutional (churches and schools), residential stands from Gweru City Council during the period January 2009 to date and have queries relating to the purchase of their stands to come forward and discuss the queries with the Chairperson of the Land Audit at the Civic Centre in office number 361second floor,” said Ms Gwatipedza. “Kindly bring documents/information relating to the stand including, offer letter, receipts for payments made, sale agreement, approved building plans, plan approval fees receipts and construction stage forms.” She said those who purchased stands within the last 10 years must bring documentation to council by tomorrow. Council officials, speaking on condition of anonymity said the land audit was long overdue since several illegal structures needed to be exposed. “A lot of infills now have stands which are not in the council system. So we need the land audit to bring normalcy so that council benefits from rates and water services,” said a council official on condition of anonymity. Ms Gwatipedza said recently that the council will institute an audit following the sacking of former Mayor, Councillor Hamutendi Kombayi. Ms Gwatipedza said they had been in the dark on the number of houses or commercial properties under the local authority.
