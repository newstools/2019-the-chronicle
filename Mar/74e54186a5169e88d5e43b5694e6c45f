The Chronicle Victor Maphosa, Harare Bureau. The Zimbabwe Amalgamated Council of Churches yesterday handed over petitions calling for the unconditional removal of sanctions on Zimbabwe to the United States and British embassies and the European Union Delegation to Zimbabwe. The council gave the embassies and the EU delegation a 21 day ultimatum to respond to theirs petition which stated in detail how the illegal sanctions on Zimbabwe is derailing economic development in the country. ZACC patron, Mr Jimayi Muduvuri, who delivered the petition while accompanied by members of churches affiliated to the council who were singing songs denouncing the sanctions, said they had decided to add their voice to the unconditional removal of sanctions on Zimbabwe. “For nearly two decades, Zimbabwe has been bleeding because of these sanctions and we are saying enough is enough,” he said. Mr Muduvuri said the West have been lying to the world that the sanctions were targeted at a few individuals in the country yet they were affecting everyone. “We are saying enough to the lies which the West has been feeding us that these sanctions are targeting a few individuals. Why are the lines of credit to Zimbabwe blocked and why are there are no investors from the West who are doing business here? “We are calling for the removal of these illegal sanctions and we are giving those who have been given the petition 21 days to respond.” Mr Muduvuri said last year’s free, fair and peaceful harmonised elections under President Mnangagwa were a clear indication that Zimbabwe has reformed and as such the US and its allies should remove the sanctions and give Zimbabwe a chance to develop. Asked what he the council would do if the embassies and the EU defy the ultimatum, Mr Muduvuri said they will announce their next course of action then. US president Donald Trump recently extended sanctions imposed by his country on Zimbabwe by another year.
