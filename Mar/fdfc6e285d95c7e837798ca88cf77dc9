The Chronicle Daniel Nemukuyu, Harare Bureau THE High Court yesterday freed MDC Alliance legislator for Kuwadzana East Chalton Hwende on $3 000 bail but barred him from addressing political gatherings and using the social media for public incitement pending finalisation of his criminal case. Hwende is being accused of subverting a constitutionally-elected Government. High Court judge, Justice Davison Foroma ordered Hwende to report to the police twice every week and to surrender his travel documents with the court’s registry. Hwende, according to the bail ruling, should surrender title deeds to the tune of $50 000 as surety. The judge also ordered the politician to surrender his passport and to report to the police twice a week. He must not interfere with State witnesses or police investigations. Hwende initially appeared before a Harare magistrate on Wednesday where he was remanded in custody to March 20. That prompted him to approach the High Court for bail. The State alleges that during the period extending from December 28 to 31, 2018, Hwende posted on his Twitter handle messages that in their nature had the effect of inciting the people to revolt against the Government both in his personal capacity and as a Movement for Democratic Change Alliance Member of Parliament for Kuwadzana East constituency. Hwende’s Twitter posts allegedly incited the public to overthrow the constitutionally-elected Government of Zimbabwe by engaging in mass protests characterised by violence hooliganism. It is the State’s case that Hwende’s Twitter messages told members of the public that 2019 should be the year of the final push to what he called a new Zimbabwe. The State alleges that as a result of the nationwide public violence committed by demonstrators following incitement by Hwende, lives were lost, multitudes of members of the public and police officers were injured, while some police institutions were attacked. Some police vehicles were damaged and burnt beyond recognition.
