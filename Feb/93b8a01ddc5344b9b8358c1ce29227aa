A Shurugwi man allegedly broke into a tuck-shop where he raped and murdered a 16-year-old attendant, pulled her body out of the building, doused it with engine oil and setting it on fire. After committing the horrific acts, Brighton Mahara (26) allegedly stole groceries worth $587 from the tuck-shop where Marvellous Dawurike worked as she waited for her O-Level results to come out. Mahara yesterday appeared before Gweru Magistrate, Ms Beaulity Dube, facing theft and murder charges. He was not asked to plead. Ms Dube advised him to apply for bail at the High Court. It is the State case that on January 6, Mahara allegedly visited Plot 9 in Valle Village in Shurugwi and proceeded to a tuck-shop where Dawurike was employed.
She also slept in the tuck shop. Upon reaching the tuck-shop, Mahara allegedly broke in and started stealing groceries. Dawurike noticed that there was an intruder in the tuck shop and screamed for help. Seeing that there was someone in the tuck-shop, Mahara allegedly assaulted Dawurike with fists all over her body. The court heard that Mahara allegedly raped her before striking her twice with a stone on the face. Mahara allegedly dragged Dawurike’s body outside the tuck-shop, poured engine oil over it and set it on fire. After committing the heinous crime, Mahara allegedly stole groceries from the tuck-shop worth $587, and a radio. He allegedly proceeded to Gweru where he gave the grocery to his wife. He was arrested on January 30 in Shurugwi following a tip off and was found in possession of the stolen radio and the deceased’s identity card. Mr Lovemore Mahachi prosecuted.
