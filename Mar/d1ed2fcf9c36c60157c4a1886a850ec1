PREMIESHIP football side Yadah Stars’ new coach, Genesis Mangombe, got his stint underway yesterday when he took the team through their paces for the first time. Mangombe was confirmed as the club’s new coach last month after taking over from Thomas Ruzive, who moved to Black Rhinos as assistant to Herbert Maruwa. The 35-year-old Caf A licence holder is a police officer by profession and delayed his pre-season since he was waiting for his clearance by the Zimbabwe Republic Police. Yadah chairman, Everson Chatambudza, told our Harare Bureau they received written permission from the police force last week to employ the youthful coach. This will be his first job in the top-flight league after spending most of his coaching career in the lower divisions with clubs that include ZRP Harare and Hetchford FC. Mangombe was snatched from the Academy 2063 with the objective to spearhead Yadah’s new initiative to focus on development of young players. “I’m humbled by the trust and faith that Yadah have put in me to showcase my philosophy and style of play as the coach. “I would want to assure our stakeholders, in particular our fans, that it will be an exciting season for us. “The club’s hierarchy explained and outlined the 2019 season objectives were to develop and promote young football talent. “But that does not give me room to relax. I also have my ambitions and goals to make a mark in the top-flight league and I’m confident that we will finish in the top eight,” said Mangombe. Mangombe said that he will have a competitive team from the group of players in camp. “I’m happy that the club managed to retain some of our important players like Byron Madzokere and Leeroy Mavhunga and we also signed some players that I believe will help us achieve our objectives as a club,” said Mangombe.
