SOUTH Africa’s Mlindo the Vocalist who is billed to perform at BAC Leisure in Bulawayo on Saturday seems to have committed to perform at two shows in two countries on that day. This is after a poster of SA afro-soul singer – Donald for his “10 years of Donald” gig taking place on Saturday at Sun City – emerged with Mlindo advertised as one of the performing artistes. After seeing this poster, local fans of the Macala hit-maker were puzzled as to how the artiste would perform at both events on one night as the SA gig begins at 6:30PM. While gates for the BAC show open at 2PM, Mlindo will likely perform in the evening. And even if he performs in the afternoon, he would not be able to catch a flight back to Johannesburg as the only flight (South African Airlink) on Saturday departs at lunch time meaning that Mlindo would need to hire a private jet to attend both shows which would be costly for the local promoter – 3D Events. Quizzed about the double booking, event organiser Mduduzi Mdlongwa issued a video drop by Mlindo in which the artiste made it clear that he was not attending the Sun City show. “I can’t wait to be in Zimbabwe this weekend. I’m not going to Sun City as I’m going to be in Zimbabwe. I just needed to clarify this and will do another official video later,” said Mlindo on the clip. It remains to be seen if Mlindo will keep his word and grace the Zimbabwe event as most South African acts are notorious for claiming to have missed their flights to Zimbabwe each time they double book.
