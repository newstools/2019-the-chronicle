Up-and-coming hip hop artiste Union 5 is among the 10 African artistes selected by emPawa100 and Nigeria’s Mr Eazi for an opportunity to do a four-week master-class. The top 10 artistes who have been selected will head to Cape Town, South Africa with Mr Eazi, a renowned music producer Diplo who is part of the group Major Lazer and Raye. There they, along with other A-list artistes, producers and industry specialists will share their knowledge for a four-week master-class. Union 5, real name Tafara Dondo, is the only Zimbabwean who made it into the top 10. The 20-year-old rapper took to social media to express how excited he was for making it into the top 10. “God, you stay pulling through for me here I am TOP TEN!!! I’m at a loss for word thank you to everyone who has been supporting and has been with me on this journey. Thank you so much. LET’S GET IT.” After the master-class, two artistes will be selected to go and perform with Mr Eazi in London at the ‘Ghana Party In The Park.’ Union 5 wowed fans last year at the Change A Life Concert headlined by South Africa hip hop artiste Nasty C in Harare. Since then he has been performing at several shows and also received co-signs from Zimbabwean hip hop veterans like Tehn Diamond. The competition kicked off last year in December. Aspiring musicians were required to upload a 30-second video performing on Instagram and tag emPawa Africa and Mr Eazi and some of his industry friends would select the top 10. One hundred budding African artistes were chosen and the Zimbabwean artistes who made it into the top 100 included Gary Mupanzure, Hillzy, Mimi Tarukwana, Cleo, Union 5, Fusion 5 and Mangwiro. They will each receive $3 000 which they are supposed to use to shoot and market their music videos.
