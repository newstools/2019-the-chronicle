The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Golden Social Soccer League enters Week Three tomorrow with seven teams still searching for their first wins of the season while four have recorded a 100 percent start in the 18 team league. Yet to celebrate a win from the opening two games are Revolution, Soccer Sunday Hillside, Wolves, All Stars, Amavevane, Izinsizwa and Maranatha while TelOne, RBZ, star studded Ambassadors and Railstars all had a perfect start to the season. TelOne and Ambassadors headline this weekend’s fixtures and their game is set for AmaZulu Sports Club. Last weekend TelOne pummelled Wolves 11-3 while Ambassadors laboured to a 2-1 away win to a spirited Revolution at the outside Barbourfields Stadium grounds.
