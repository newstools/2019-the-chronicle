The Chronicle Responses to “Deal Done”. Well done Warriors for qualifying for AFCON but I feel there is a lot needed to be done to strengthen our team so that we will avoid elimination in the preliminary stages at the Afcon. – Dalubuhle Nkosana. Well done Chidzambwa for you have made us feel great. Sports is a great tool for uniting people. –Gakangoma. *** Response to “Byo restructuring on course”. Let’s go and talk to the people, people will not come to Zanu-PF if we don’t talk to them. We have to engage them and this is only achieved by being servants of the people like what the President says. The cell system is very important so that the party is well structured from grass roots level upwards. — Dalubuhle Nkosana.
