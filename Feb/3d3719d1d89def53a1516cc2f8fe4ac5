KWEKWE-BASED dairy producer, Dendairy, is set to commission three new packaging lines as part of the company’s ongoing expansion programme. The firm has embarked on an expansion programme with a view to having doubled its output levels by early 2019. In an interview, Dendairy director Mr Darryl Archibald said they were putting final touches to the machinery before its commissioning. “We are set to commission three new lines very soon; we are waiting for a couple of parts that are needed to complete the assembling. “The equipment is already on site but due to the current economic challenges, we could not complete it in time,” he said. Mr Archibald said despite the commissioning being delayed by two months, the company was not giving up, adding that the Government should be commended for pulling all stops in trying to solve the economic challenges. “We are committed to continue planning that we get the new lines running. It’s really difficult because every day you wake up to a new challenge. “We would have wanted to close in and wind up the assembling of the new lines but we are trying to close it off. “The President’s open for business mantra is correct, there are just one or two things that need to be solved,” he said. Mr Archibald said the Government should expedite currency reforms to promote economic recovery. “The rest of the things are good, but the currency problem is the only challenge that needs to be sorted out and everything will be fine.” He said his company was taking advantage of its geographical location to create partnerships with dairy farmers. “In Midlands we enjoy the geographical advantage, for example, we have formed partnerships with dairy farmers. “Being in Kwekwe in the Midlands gives us an advantage over our competitors in Harare. “We have access to clean water from the council and we also have good deals with our dairy farmers,” said Mr Archibald.
