THE director of ZBC Television drama series, Kuchina the Genesis, which has been nominated for the Outstanding Screen Production (Television Series), Blessing Gatsi, says he is looking forward to winning his first National Arts Merit Award (Nama). Gatsi said he was excited that the Nama recognised the efforts that they are making in an industry which is very tough in Zimbabwe. “When I heard that Kuchina was nominated for a Nama, I was very excited and emotional at the same time. This is because it hasn’t been easy making this production as we’ve encountered so many challenges since we premiered in 2017,” said Gatsi. He said, however, that award recognition alone was not enough as they desperately needed financial support for their production. Gatsi said it was only when such productions like Kuchina got the needed funding that the arts industry could improve and grow. <img class="size-medium wp-image-444725" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-11-288x360.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="360" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-11-288x360.jpg 288w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-11-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-11-544x680.jpg 544w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-11.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 288px) 100vw, 288px" /> The Kuchina cast “I appreciate that we are being recognised for our works but what we need most in this industry is funding. In some countries people make a living through TV productions but here in Zimbabwe it’s part-time job. People come to the shoot after work and they will be exhausted so we cannot get the best,” he said. The Kuchina producer spoke highly about the other productions nominated in the same category saying: “Muzita Rababa and Tunga are marvellous productions. We’re one and we want to achieve the same goal. I’ve great respect for Shem Zemura and Willard Magombedze, they’re doing an amazing job.” Kuchina the Genesis premiered on ZBCtv in May 2017 and it is a drama series which is centred on four women living in a fictional town called Moonshine and it is aimed at tackling issues affecting women in their day-to-day lives. The drama series features some talented actresses like the former Studio 263 actor Tinopona “Tin Tin” Katsande as well as Ashley Masendeke. Last year Shem Zemura’s drama series Muzita Rababa scooped the Outstanding Screen Production (Television Series) award.
