The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma CLEMENT Magwaza lived up to his promise when he celebrated his 38th birthday at Nkulumane Hall in Bulawayo on Sunday night with a splendid event where food was given to patrons for free. As early as 5PM, the dusty streets of Nkulumane were a hive of activity as all roads led to the venue where the artiste also celebrated 20 years in the music industry. The hall was full to the brim and as promised, the party’s attendees were treated to free traditional meals. Warming up the stage for the birthday boy were arts groups Godoe no Amzoe, Bhamuza, Ikhaya Arts and Sungura Masters. Taking to the stage just after midnight, Magwaza showed that with age comes maturity through his stellar performance. He performed till the wee hours of the morning as the show ended at around 5AM. After his performance, he thanked revellers for their good behaviour and attending the celebration in their numbers. “It’s rare to hold such an event where people drink all night long but do not cause chaos or vandalise property. I’m happy that my fans behaved as there was no violence whatsoever.” He added: “The support that music lovers continue to give us as local artists is overwhelming and we promise to continue giving them good music.” — @mthabisi_mthire
