The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter DESPITE having one of their worst pre-season preparations due to a players’ strike over unpaid salaries, the Highlanders leadership seems not to have sought a bailout from anyone. Highlanders’ senior players have been on strike over unpaid January and February salaries and only trained for two weeks in the past five weeks. Bulawayo businessman and philanthropist, Raj Modi, who is also the Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, revealed that he had not been approached directly or indirectly by the club he has often helped previously. Modi revealed this to Chronicle Sport after tweeting on Tuesday that he yearned for a Bosso title win. “No, they haven’t approached me this year. Maybe they came to my office to look for me, but didn’t find me. I must, however, state that in previous years I have worked with the club well where I assisted them over a number of things which obviously I cannot go public or brag about, but as for this year and with regards to the issues affecting the club, I haven’t been approached,” said Modi. Chronicle Sport is also reliably informed that Highlanders and telecoms company NetOne have formally reached an agreement over sponsorship, with the two parties set to announce the package before the end of this week. “From what I gather, it’s a much improved deal this time around. I am not exactly sure of the monetary value, but I can authoritatively say it’s more than double the previous arrangement,” said a source privy to the deal. Bosso’s rivals Dynamos last week clinched a $1 million a year deal with tobacco company Green Leaf Tobacco.
