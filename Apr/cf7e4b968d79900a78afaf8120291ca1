The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter A multitude thronged the White City Stadium on Friday night for the Spiritual Spectacles Night that was hosted by Goodness & Mercy Ministries (GMM). The event started at 8PM with a spiritual performance from Sisters of Paradise who performed songs from their ‘Ngiyohlala Ethembeni’ album. Gospel songstress Agatha Murudzwa who was cheered by the crowd when she took to the stage next, touched many when she performed songs like Makorokoto and Makatendeka. Bethany Pasinawako-Ngolomi who released her fifth album last year wowed the crowd with her breakout hit single Ndinzwereyi. Energetic Mathias Mhere was a crowd favourite as people did not want him to leave the stage as he performed hit after hit. He performed fan favourites like Favour and Vimba Na Jehovah. Sadly, Mhere who had said he would launch his song dedicated to Cyclone Idai victims at the show, ended up not performing it as he ran out of time. “I wanted to finish off my performance with that song but we ran out of time. However, people should expect to hear the song soon as it’ll be released anytime from now,” Mhere said. After Mhere’s performance, Prophet T. Freddy proved that he is a man of many gifts as he showcased his singing prowess when he performed his song Tinopembera before he started prophesying to the crowds and performing miracles.
