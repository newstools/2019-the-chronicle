THE Zimbabwe Volleyball Association (ZVA) is set to hold its annual general meeting (AGM) on February 16 in Matabeleland North province. Tawanda Sithole, the ZVA secretary-general, said the association will be approaching all relevant stakeholders this week to come up with a draft calendar of events to be tabled at the AGM for deliberation. “This week I’ll be approaching the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) so that they give us a roadmap and dates for the upcoming season. “For now we don’t have anything feasible so the engagement of stakeholders will be done with the hope of having a ZVA executive meeting on Saturday,” said Sithole. He said he was optimistic there won’t be disturbances that will delay their preparations and is looking forward to the executive meeting. “Last season ended on a high and we hope to improve by ensuring that we limit setbacks. “The reason we intend to sort all logistics before the season starts is to ensure there’s smooth sailing next season,” he said. Last season saw Support Unit (men), University of Zimbabwe Wolves (men), Harare City (women), UZ Wolves (women) and Support Unit (women) representing the country in the Zone 6 Club Championship in Durban, South Africa. UZ Wolves men were the best performing Zimbabwean team at that competition, after claiming a silver medal following their 1-3 loss to Police VI from Botswana in the final. Sithole said there’s a lot the clubs learnt in their South African sojourn and the association wants to make this season better than 2018. — @DecoDecent2
