The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter NYASHA Chikosi beat fellow Zimbabwean Kudzai Chapepa 6-1, 6-3 in the girls’ category of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) Under-14 tournament held at Bulawayo Country Club at the weekend. In the boys’ section, Tompson Tom lifted the title after beating fellow Zimbabwean Benedict Badza 6-0, 6-2 in the final. The three-day tournament attracted more than 80 players from around the continent. The event is an ITF world rankings tourney, which enables players to improve their rankings. Tournament director Cliff Nokwara was impressed with the turnout. “This is a developmental tournament where young players get international recognition and I’m happy that a number of Zimbabwean players participated. The ITF games give players a chance to earn points that put them in a good position to rub shoulders with other international players,” said Nokwara. He said Zimbabwe players had fared well and hopes more local players will register positive results in future tournaments. “We are pleased to play host to tournaments of this magnitude because not only do they give exposure to our players, but they also market them. “This also offers players that cannot afford to play outside the country an opportunity to show their talent against international opponents on home soil,” said Nokwara. — @DecoDecent20
