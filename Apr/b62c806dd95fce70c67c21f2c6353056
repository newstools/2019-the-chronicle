The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) will hold the final qualifier for the annual ZITF Four-Minute Mile race at White City Stadium tomorrow. The Delta Beverages sponsored competition traditionally takes place in April during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. The Fair runs from April 23-27. The qualifying time for the Coca-Cola ZITF Four-Minute Mile is four minutes 31 seconds. Those that run within this time proceed to the finals. Manuel Mpofu, the Bab chairman, said 26 athletes, including defending champion Wellington Varevi of Black Rhinos, had already qualified for the finals. “We are left with two qualifying races for the ZITF Four-Minute Mile finals. We will have the final qualifier in Bulawayo on Independence Day at White City Stadium. “The last qualifier is set for Saturday in Mutare where the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) will be holding the second-leg of the JM Busha Triangular Series,” said Mpofu. Athletes that qualify for the final will compete in the semi-finals of the race on April 26, with 20 that emerge with the best times proceeding to the final set for April 27 at the ZITF main arena. Organisers of the competition have maintained last year’s prizes and the winner will get $800, the runner-up ($400), while the third-placed runner will get $300.
