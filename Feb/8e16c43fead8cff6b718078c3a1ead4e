GOALKEEPER, Wellington Muuya, completed his move to Highlanders yesterday after successfully terminating his contract with Zifa Southern Region Division One League side, Bulawayo City. Muuya, who turns 23 in June, joined City from Bantu Rovers at the beginning of 2018, deputising Takudzwa Ndoro and later Kelvin Nyoni. The Victoria Falls-bred Muuya will compete for a starting place with reigning Castle Lager Premier Soccer League Goalkeeper of the Year Ariel Sibanda and former Mutare City Rovers shot stopper, Alfred Chiname. “Muuya has signed a contract with the club. He immediately joined the pre-season camp with Chiname, which means we now have two goalkeepers at the pre-season physical training. He has been one of the coaches’ recommendations and we are happy to have him as part of the Highlanders family,” said Nhlanhla Dube, the Highlanders chief executive officer. With Sibanda having walked out of camp in protest over unpaid January salaries alongside substitute goalkeeper, Nedrick Madeya, it is likely that the latter, who reportedly went club hunting without the club’s permission last month, will be released. Sibanda is also expected to be sanctioned by the club for his role in leading players to desert camp. Muuya joins the list of new signings that has his rival Chiname, former Young Warriors’ attacking pair of Bukhosi “Zakhu” Sibanda and Prince Dube, ex-Dynamos winger Cleopas Kapupurika and former national Under-20 defensive midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku. Utility player Mbekezeli Sibanda and Zambian striker Peter Nyirenda, who is waiting for his work permit, are among some of Bosso’s new signings. — @ZililoR
