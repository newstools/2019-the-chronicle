The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A HONDA Fit driver has been sentenced to five years in prison for kidnapping and robbing a passenger after failing to rape her at knife-point as she was menstruating. Jonathan Mpofu (36) from New Lobengula suburb in Bulawayo robbed the woman, whose name has been withheld for ethical reasons, of groceries valued at $624. Mpofu appeared before West Commonage magistrate, Ms Sibongile Marondedze, who sentenced him to five years in jail for kidnap, attempted rape, robbery and theft charges. “With all the evidence brought to the court, you are found guilty as charged on all four counts. You have been convicted of serious offences and you deserve to be jailed for that,” said Ms Marondedze. The magistrate suspended two years on condition that Mpofu does not commit a similar offence in the next five years. However, Mpofu begged for lenience and told the court that he was already serving another eight years in prison for another case. “I have four children that need to be taken care of Your Worship, five more years are too much. I was previously sentenced to eight years in prison at Tredgold Courts for theft,” he said. Prosecuting, Ms Concilia Ncube said on February 10 this year, the complainant boarded an Emakhandeni suburb-bound Honda Fit in the city centre which had five other passengers. She said the driver dropped all the other passengers and the complainant was the only one left. “On their way to victim’s place of residence, the driver diverted the route to Siyepambili Drive near Ngozi Mine dump site and demanded sex at knife point,” said Ms Ncube. She said Mpofu unbuttoned the complainant’s trousers only to find out that she was menstruating. “Mpofu became frustrated and robbed the victim of her groceries that included 1kg of biscuits, Cremora powdered milk, pilchards, soap, noodles, Cerevita, a rim of bond paper and cornflakes,” Ms Ncube said. Police launched investigations leading to Mpofu’s arrest. — @sharonbuwe
