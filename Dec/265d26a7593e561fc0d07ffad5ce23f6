The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A 17-YEAR–OLD girl who was accused of making a false rape report told the court that she was blackmailed through witchcraft to withdraw charges. The girl from Emganwini suburb, whose name is withheld to protect her identity, said the accused’s mother, who is also her neighbour bewitched her into menstruating for more than two weeks and told her she would bleed to death if she did not drop charges against her son. The girl said the accused’s mother forced her into telling police she had lied about the rape and she got arrested. The minor pleaded not guilty to deliberately supplying false information to a public authority before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove. She was remanded out of custody to January 10 next year for continuation of trial. For the State, Mr Stewart Madzore said on April 25 this year, the minor made a false report that she was raped by her neighbour. “At around 12PM, the accused person reported rape knowing that the information was false. “The accused person later came to confess that she made a false report  and completed an affidavit,” he said. The minor, in defence, said: “I was only trying to protect myself from accused’s mother. I experienced some misfortunes after the threats as I bled for some weeks. I even went to hospital and the bleeding did not stop until I dropped the charges. “I was fearing for my life and my health,” she said tearfully. The court heard after the minor tried to stop the bleeding through the help of spiritual healers, she got involved in an accident and was admitted for one week in hospital. — @sharonbuwe
