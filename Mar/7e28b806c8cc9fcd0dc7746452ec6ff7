The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo GOVERNMENT has called on construction companies in Masvingo province to combine their capacities and position themselves for lucrative tenders on the dualisation of Beitbridge-Harare-Chirundu Highway project. The multi-million dualisation project is on course with some workmen already on the ground in Beatrice and Mvuma areas. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister, Engineer Biggie Joel Matiza, is on record saying the project will be done in nine segments and would commence in Masvingo sometime in July. The segments are as follows; Skyline-Beatrice, Beatrice-Chivhu, Chivhu Town, Chivhu-Fairfield, Fairfield-Masvingo, Masvingo Town, Masvingo-Ngundu, Ngundu- Bubi and Bubi- Beitbridge. The rest of the road to Chirundu is going through procurement process. The project will be constructed by local contractors and it will be fully funded by Government. Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Ezra Chadzamira said local companies should pool resources together in order to benefit from the massive project. “We expect our own companies to stampede for tenders and they can only succeed if they have the capacity to do the work hence the need to pool resources together,” said Minister Chadzamira. He said many opportunities await local companies as a result of devolution which requires provinces to use own resources to develop their areas. The long-awaited highway project is set to create at least 300 000 jobs with local construction companies — @walterbmswazie2.
