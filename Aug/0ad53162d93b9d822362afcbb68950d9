Nyamuromba said Zimdancehall was the most sought after genre in the country currently hence why they have invited the dancehall powerhouse to perform at their club. “We’re so excited to be hosting the Judgement Yard family as they’ll give the Bulawayo populace a taste of the popular dancehall music. Preparations for the event are going well and we want to encourage people to come in their numbers and experience Judgement Yard’s live performance.” On the night, Judgement Yard will be supported by local DJs Crazy Black, Star, Slamma and Crazy Ghetto Entertainment DJs.
