HIGHLANDERS’ members will elect a vice-chairman and treasurer at the club house tomorrow. Incumbent vice-chairman Modern Ngwenya is being challenged by club benefactor and businessman Longwe Ndlovu, while treasurer Donald Ndebele will battle it out with Charles Ndlovu. Cosmas Sikhosana, the Highlanders’ electoral committee chairman, said the elections are set for 10am. “Elections are on at 10am and we encourage members to come early for registration formalities so that the whole process is done speedily. Longwe Ndlovu and Modern Ngwenya had their nomination papers for the vice-chairman position sailing through and the treasurer candidates are banker Charles Ndlovu and Donald Ndebele. These are the only people who collected nomination forms,” said Sikhosana. They each paid a $200 deposit for the nomination forms and any candidate that gets at least 10 percent of the total votes cast will get their money back. Longwe is known as the man who facilitated the deal that brought striker Roderick Mutuma to Highlanders in 2017 after he pledged to add onto his signing on fees and supplement his salary. Mutuma, however, left Bosso midway into the 2017 season. While there is usually excitement over the vice-chairman’s post as shown by four candidates contesting in 2016, there is usually little enthusiasm when it comes to the treasurer’s position. Ndebele defeated Ndlovu in the last election in 2016. In 2016, Ngwenya polled 90 votes to beat the present Highlanders’ chairman Kenneth Mhlophe, then vice-chairman Mgcini Sibhalo Mpofu and Nkosinathi Ncube. In the treasurer’s election, Ndebele shrugged off Ndlovu’s challenge with 115 votes to 86. Whoever is voted in will be in office for three years unless Highlanders successfully amend their constitution and align it with the national association’s four-year term. — @ZililoR
