The Chronicle US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to “totally destroy and obliterate” the Turkish economy if Ankara took any action he considered “off-limits” following his decision to withdraw US forces from northeastern Syria. “As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!)” Trump tweeted. The withdrawal, announced by the White House late Sunday, was swiftly condemned by a bipartisan group of politicians over concerns that it could open the way for a Turkish attack on Kurdish-led forces long allied with Washington. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican who is usually vocally supportive of Trump, said the decision is a “disaster in the making”. Graham said he planned to introduce a resolution calling on the White House to reverse its decision. He also threatened legislation to impose economic sanctions on Turkey. He predicted such legislation would be veto-proof. The US withdrawal marks a major shift in US policy and effectively abandons an American ally in the battle against ISIL, which took over swaths of Syria before being defeated a year ago. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) warned that Turkish invasion will overturn the victory over the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) armed group. The group said he viewed Trump’s decision as a “stab in the back”.  — AFP
