MATABELELAND Tuskers will be hoping to put up an improved show to make up for a woeful Logan Cup performance when they take on MidWest Rhinos in two Pro-50 Championship matches at Queens Sports Club this weekend. Tuskers finished at the bottom of the Logan Cup table after failing to win any of their six matches. The Bulawayo-based franchise will be hoping for better fortunes against Rhinos from Kwekwe when they meet at Queens Sports Club. Rhinos, who are presently second on the league table with four points from two games, have one of the strongest and most experienced sides in the competition. The visitors head into the first match tomorrow bubbling with confidence following a three-wicket win over Mountaineers in their last Pro-50 game. Former Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer, who is back from injury, national team players Brendan Taylor, Kyle Jarvis, Tarisai Musakanda, Tendai Chisoro, Neville Madziva, Peter Moor and Carl Mumba are among the players Rhinos can count on for strong performances in the two games. Tuskers on the other hand have a flexible team made up of experienced and talented young players. Coached by former national team seam bowler Douglas Hondo and assisted by Mbekezeli Mabuza and Njabulo Ncube, Tuskers have the experienced quartet of Christopher Mpofu, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza and spin-bowler John Nyumbu on their books. Opening batsman Brian Chari, young up-and-coming all-rounder Ernest Masuku, pace bowler Sheunopa Musekwa, upcoming spinner Aisnley Ndlovu and Stephen Chimamhiwa are expected in Tuskers’ team for the weekend encounters. Also fighting for positions in the Tuskers team to face Rhinos are Thabo Mboyi, Charlton Tshuma, Nkosana Mpofu, Tafara Mpariwa, who captained the side in the Logan Cup, and Cunningham Ncube. – @ZililoR
