The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter UNIFORMED services sides Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services as well as Zimbabwe Defence Forces remain the only two unbeaten teams in the Glow Petroleum-funded Rainbow Amateur Netball League. Correctional, Falcons and Beta Queens are the only teams to have surpassed the 1 000-goal mark, although Falcons have played five games more than leaders, Correctional. This past weekend, Glow Petroleum, who are seventh with 26 points, six points behind the leaders, played to a 45-45 stalemate against Platinum Queens. This result dented both teams’ prospects of closing the gap on the leaders. Correctional Services hammered Golden Valley 94-16 to march towards their second title on the trot. ZDF can surpass them by a single point if they win their outstanding match. However, the two unbeaten sides collide this weekend in what should be a cracker of an encounter. ZDF coach Joel Wise Sibanda believes the Saturday encounter will literally project the destiny of the championship. “This weekend it will be a deciding game. Correctional are a good side, but I think I will give them a good run. If we win, our chances of winning the league title will be very high. We are playing at home, we have to utilise our home advantage because they are also deadly at their home ground,” said Sibanda.
