The Chronicle JOHANNESBURG – South African giants Kaizer Chiefs may have dismissed rumours linking star Zimbabwean forward Khama Billiat with a return to Mamelodi Sundowns, but KickOff.com looks at reasons why he should be allowed to leave. But Kaizer Chiefs have made it clear that Billiat is going nowhere and KickOff.com also looks at why it’s a good decision to keep him at Naturena. Mamelodi Sundowns have shown an interest in the player and were said to have offered R15 million to have the player back at Chloorkop, but Amakhosi are not tempted at all to cash in on a player Pitso Mosimane adores. Going back to Sundowns would all but guarantee success for Billiat. He’d be going into an environment where players are used to winning trophies and competiting at the highest level in the Caf Champions League. – KickOff.com
