The Chronicle Ellina Mhlanga, Harare Bureau TRIATHLON Zimbabwe have named a strong six-member team to represent the country at the Africa Championships next month in Mauritius. The athletes will compete as individuals and, in the mixed team relay events, at the two-day competition on June 1 and 2. The team is made up of Mikayla Colegrave, George Ascott, Luke Steffens, Andie Kuipers, Luke Heathcote-Hacker and Matt Denslow. National coach, Pamela Fulton, said with all the athletes that went for the South Africa Championships in March eligible for the Africa Championships, they had time trials on Sunday at Hellenic School and Donnybrook to finalise the relay team. “For, the first time ever, there is going to be a mixed team relay event,’’ said Fulton. “So, on day one, is the individual race and then on day two is the mixed team relay event. “The trials that we had on Sunday were to select the team that is going to be competing in the mixed team relay event. “That consists of two boys and two girls. “We have only got Andie and Mikayla going as girls, so they automatically went into the team relay. “But, with regards to our Under-19 boys, we had three of them so we had to do a swim time trial, a bike time trial and a run time trial and their three times added together, the two fastest times became our two boys who will be racing in the relay event,” said Fulton. All the six triathletes will compete in the individual event while Kuipers, Colegrave, Denslow and Steffens make up the relay team. Fulton said she is looking forward to the championships and is optimistic of positive results from the individuals and the relay team. However, she pointed out South Africa as their biggest challenge.
