The Chronicle Editor — The Passengers’ Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) welcomes the introduction of the tap and go payment system by Zupco. It brings convenience to the commuting public. However, there is concern that passengers are being made to buy the tap and go card for $10. This amount overstretches the budget of passengers, most of whom are not formally employed. PAZ is also concerned that Zupco is prioritising passengers with tap and go cards such that those who will be paying with cash are either left behind or are the last to board the bus. Some of the passengers who will be paying with cash, at times, would have been the first ones in the queue. The purchase of tap and go cards should not be made through this kind of duress. We are calling upon Zupco to revise its timetable. Many people who rely on Zupco are often late for work because buses start operating later in the morning. Many people leave their work stations after 7PM and there will be no buses to transport them home. The buses that Zupco is hiring must be roadworthy. Most of the buses are not fit to transport people.
