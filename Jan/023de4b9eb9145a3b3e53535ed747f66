Zimbabwean women yesterday mourned the Jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi with a powerful social media campaign #Dhuku4Tuku which trended at number one in South Africa and Zimbabwe on Twitter as they posted pictures on social media wearing head wraps (doeks). The campaign was meant to mourn and celebrate the impact of Tuku’s music especially his music advocating for women and children’s rights. A doek (iqhiye) is worn by women at church, weddings, funerals and other such social gatherings. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-434450" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/DxxNxEaWwAAnMAn.jpg-large-360x344.jpg" alt="" width="642" height="613" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/DxxNxEaWwAAnMAn.jpg-large-360x344.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/DxxNxEaWwAAnMAn.jpg-large.jpg 678w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" /> Activist/feminist Tsimba Kadzi said: “Oliver Mtukudzi’s support for women’s struggle is well documented, from his role and song in the film Neria which is about inheritance rights for widows and also condemning child marriages. Today women honour Tuku by wearing black and a head wrap.” Tuku celebrated women through his songs such as Neria which advocated for the property rights of women. In Tozeza Baba the singer condemned the domestic abuse of women and now women are honouring him for what he did through his music. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-434452" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Dhuku4Tuku1-1-360x277.jpg" alt="" width="649" height="499" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Dhuku4Tuku1-1-360x277.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Dhuku4Tuku1-1.jpg 677w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /> Oliver Mtukudzi was a UNICEF Goodwill ambassador for Southern Africa, human rights activist and a philanthropist.
