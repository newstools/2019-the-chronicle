NGEZI Platinum Stars coach Erol Akbay is expected to touch down in the country this afternoon from his home in the Netherlands. The Dutch mentor was appointed in December last year following the sacking of Tonderai Ndiraya. Clifton Kadurira, who was Ndiraya’s assistant, held fort on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. But, the gaffer, who secured the team’s qualification into the Premiership four years, ago fell short of pushing the title race to the wire. Kadurira couldn’t get a role among the backroom coaching staff as Akbay opted for Cosmas “Tsano” Zulu and Tendai Chikuni. The two have been taking care of the club’s pre-season preparations in Akbay’s absence. The Dutchman was initially scheduled to fly in two weeks ago but he encountered some logistical delays related to his work permit. Club chief executive, Nyasha Kadenge, confirmed the former Highlanders coach will be in the country this afternoon. “Our new coach Erol Akbay is arriving this Friday (today) afternoon. We are delighted to confirm that all what has been delaying him has now resolved and we will be looking forward to a fruitful season with him. “We are a team which has been quiet in the off-season as we have been waiting for our coach and now that he will be available, starting Saturday (tomorrow), it will be interesting to see him in charge. “We have been holding our pre-season preparations under the watchful eyes of the assistant coaches. “All his papers are in place, including the work permit.” She said her team will be fighting for honours this season.
