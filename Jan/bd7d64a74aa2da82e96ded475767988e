WITH just over five months to go before the 2019 Netball World Cup in Liverpool, England, national coach Lloyd Makunde says they need to utilise the time left to ensure they are in a position to compete well. The World Cup will take place from July 12 to 21 with 16 countries vying for the title. “Personally, I always watch Australia play, even before I was appointed national coach. They play very well, so it’s an uphill task but we are not going there to just go and watch them beat us,’’ he said. “The Northern Ireland team, I have watched like four of their recent games and then Sri Lanka I think they have got the tallest players in netball.’’ Makunde said they were looking at the fitness of the players who have been on a break. “The area of concern is the physical part. We need to get them into the best possible physical shape because they are all coming from the off-season. “We need a high level of fitness. “And we are also getting help from the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee. They actually gave us their conditioning coaches to help us,” Makunde said. The Gems’ last competition was the Diamond Challenge in South Africa late last year where they played the hosts, who fielded two teams, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia. Makunde said it was part of their preparations for the World Cup. “We thought we were fast when we went to South Africa but when we played South Africa we saw that we are not yet there. “So, during these five months or so before the World Cup, we will work on that especially on our transition,” said Makunde. The Gems coach said they have requested the national association to try and arrange friendly matches with some of the top countries such as Malawi and South Africa, who will also compete at the World Cup.
