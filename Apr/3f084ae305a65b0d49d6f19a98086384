The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE’S First Instance Body (FIB) chairman Piraishe Mabhena and the the Zifa Communications and Competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela are in Kampala, Uganda for a club licensing workshop for English-speaking countries. They are part of the 20 countries that are attending the two-day workshop whose objective is to provide federations with an update on the club licensing system at the continental level as well as to receive a full update on the status of the club licensing system at the national level. Zimbabwe is one of the few countries who have embraced the club licensing programme whose move is beginning to bear fruits despite some initial resistance from some club administrators who were still stuck in the old way of doing business. Objectives of the club licensing programme include promoting and improving the quality and the level of all football aspects. Club licensing also ensures clubs have the appropriate infrastructure, knowledge and application in respect of management and organisation, adapting and improving the clubs sporting infrastructure, improving the economic and financial capacity of the clubs through proper corporate governance and control, ensuring and guaranteeing the continuity of the international competitions of clubs during the season and allowing the parallel development and comparison among the clubs by ensuring the necessary compliance in terms of financial, sporting, legal, administrative and infrastructure criteria. The FIB decides whether or not to grant a licence to a club on the basis of a written document. “The licensor shall decide on the composition and quorum of the FIB, which quorum must be a minimum of three members with the chairman having the casting vote. In the event of a licence refusal, such decision must be in writing and set out the reason for such refusal.Members of the FIB who are either elected or appointed in accordance with the statutes of the member association may not simultaneously be part of any other judicial body of the licensor and shall at all times impartially discharge their responsibilities. The licensor may recommend administrative staff to assist the member association or its affiliated league as members of the FIB, with the exception of the licensing manager, who may not be member of the FIB,” reads an extract from Caf.
