The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Rhumba musician, Madlela Skhobokhobo, who has been nominated in the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BBA) Outstanding Tshibilika/Rhumba Artist genre says he is disappointed that he was not nominated in the Outstanding Male category. The axe-wielding artiste said he expected to be  nominated in the Outstanding Male Artiste category. “I’d like to thank people for nominating me for the work I’ve been doing over the year but the category that I’d been eyeing was the Outstanding Male. This has pained me a lot and I’m disappointed that I wasn’t nominated,” said Madlela. He said he deserved to be in the Outstanding Male Artiste category as he had worked very hard in the past year and was arguably the most booked artiste from Bulawayo. “I don’t know what criteria they used to choose the nominees but I believe that I worked very hard last year. I was one of the most booked artistes in Bulawayo as I performed almost every week in the different parts of the country. “ I also worked with companies such as Zapalala Supermarket, NetOne and Proton,” said Madlela. Nominated in the Outstanding Male category are Asaph, Zinjaziyamluma, Hwabaraty and Cal_vin. In the Outstanding Tshibilika/  Rhumba Artiste/Act category, Madlela is up against Clement Magwaza and Ndux Junior. At the inaugural awards three years ago, he won the Newcomer and Song of the Year awards for his hit track Ngamnanka. Last year, he was not nominated.
