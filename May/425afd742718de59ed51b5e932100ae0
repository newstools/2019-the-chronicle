The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter TITLE chasing Chicken Inn face troubled Highlanders in the first Bulawayo derby of the season in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match on Saturday with their tails wagging following a morale boosting away win over Manica Diamonds last weekend. The Gamecocks will be hoping to add to their seven wins over Bosso since bursting into the topflight league in 2011. However, Chicken Inn will be aware of what happened in 2017 title chase while under Rahman Gumbo when they were humiliated 4-0 by Highlanders, who had been winless in three games going into that derby. Bosso turned on the power that day with Simon Munawa grabbing a brace and Ralph Mathema and Godfrey Makarutse scoring the other two. It’s a fixture that does not take into account a team’s form as it is a derby and comes with Bosso still searching for their first win of the season after six matches. Chicken Inn have managed four wins, taking their points tally to 12, two behind leaders FC Platinum. Since Chicken Inn gained promotion into the elite league in 2011, they have lost just twice to their city neighbours. They stumbled 1-2 in the first derby on May 25, 2011, and it took Highlanders six years to record their second victory while Chicken Inn have seven wins under their belt, with the other seven encounters ending in stalemates. Only two of those draws did not produce any goals in the 2012 season while the two sides have managed four 1-1 draws and a single 2-2 stalemate. Chicken Inn have scored 20 goals in the process and Bosso have found the net 15 times. Highlanders, Bulawayo Chiefs and debutants Mushowani Stars are the three teams yet to register a win in the 18-team league.
