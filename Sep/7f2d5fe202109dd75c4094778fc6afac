The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A 60-YEAR-OLD man from Esigodini has been arrested for allegedly sexually abusing his step daughter. The man from Esihlengeni area, who cannot be named for ethical reasons, was not asked to plead when he appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Mrs Nomagugu Sibanda, facing charges of indecent assault and aggravated indecent assault. He was remanded in custody to October 1. Prosecuting, Miss Faith Mutukwa said the man first fondled his 17-year-old step daughter’s breasts and went on to insert his finger into her private parts. “On a date unknown but in the month of May, the complainant was in her bedroom hut getting dressed after taking a bath when her step father walked in. He advanced towards her and started fondling her breasts. The complainant pushed her step-father away who then left the room and warned her against reporting the matter to anyone. The complainant revealed the matter to her mother who then informed a local pastor and the accused person was reprimanded for his actions. In July the complainant’s mother went to attend a funeral and left the complainant and her two siblings aged nine and four-years-old under the custody of the accused person,’’ she said. Miss Mutukwa said on July 13 at around 5AM while the complainant was sleeping with her siblings, the accused person walked into their bedroom hut and inserted his finger in her private parts.  She said the complainant woke up when she felt that someone was violating her and realised that it was her step father. Miss Mutukwa said the complainant screamed and the accused person fled from the bedroom hut. “At around 6AM the complainant went to report the matter to the local pastor. Upon her mother’s return she also narrated to her what her step father had done. The matter was reported to the police resulting in the arrest of the accused person,’’ she said. — @DubeMatutu
