All documents and registers are gone and we are not sure how we will continue operations,” he added.

We will continue to offer HIV services while we try and find a solution,” he said. Dr Chimberengwa appealed to well wishers and donors to chip in and help in refurbishing the hospital and purchasing the lost equipment and medication. — @thamamoe
