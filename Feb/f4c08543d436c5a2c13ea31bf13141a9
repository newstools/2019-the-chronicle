GIRLS High and Kutama High schools won the girls and boys’ Lakers Foundation competition at the weekend. Girls High overcame Nkulumane High 36-27 to clinch the title, while Kutama High edged Mazowe High 36-32 in the boys’ final. Lakers senior team basketball coach Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu said the event exposed and confirmed the gap between Bulawayo schools and those from the northern part of the country. “Schools from this side are lacking something and we need to keep on holding events of this calibre in order to compete with other teams from junior level. We need to fully embrace basketball and invest in it because this tournament has confirmed that there’s a lot of talent, but lack of support and activity,” said Ndlovu. He thanked the sponsors that partnered the foundation in holding the tournament and described the event as a success. “The competition has given us a lot of optimism in our preparation to host other national competitions and I’m sure local schools learnt one or two things from their counterparts,” Ndlovu said. The foundation is also preparing to host a primary schools Under-13 event in June before hosting some international teams in November as part of the celebrations. — @DecoDecent2
