FOUR Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) league games are lined up for this weekend at Khanyisile Sports Centre in Northend suburb. There were no matches last week due to clubs’ failure to train following disturbances that rocked the city. Men’s defending champions Giants take on Highlanders A hoping to extend their unbeaten run following their 81-47 win over Clippers in their last outing. Clippers and Mavericks will also square off followed by a women’s match featuring Divas and Angels. Highlanders B will entertain Nust B. Bulawayo Basketball League promotions and marketing officer Francis Dube said: “The association is commited to having games played every weekend so that we meet our goal of finishing games on time. Players want to maximise the opportunity given to them through playing in the league and we’re hopeful that our league is the perfect platform for them to rise and advance their chances of making it to the top.” The top two teams in each category at the end of the season will represent Bulawayo at the national championships.
