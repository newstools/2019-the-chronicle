The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly assaulting a motorist who took down his vehicle registration numbers following an accident. Obey Sibanda (31) of Nkulumane 12 suburb allegedly attacked Mr Danisa Nsingo (39) of Barbourfields suburb with an iron bar once on the head. Sibanda was not asked to plead to assault when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Nomasiko Ndlovu. He was remanded to January 7 on $200 bail. Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said on Thursday last week at around 2AM, at Corner Jason Moyo Street and 10th Avenue, a misunderstanding broke out between Sibanda and Nsingo after they had had an accident. Sibanda allegedly tried to drive away from the accident scene but he later stopped after realising that Nsingo had captured his  vehicle registration numbers. “The complainant managed to capture the accused person’s vehicle registration numbers as he tried to drive away. This caused the accused to stop his vehicle, took an iron bar from his car and hit the complainant once on the head,” said the prosecutor. Mr Nsingo bled profusely following the attack. The matter was reported to the police leading to Sibanda’s arrest. — @zinyuke98
