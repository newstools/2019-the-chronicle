GWANDA Tennis Association yesterday kicked-off its three-day tennis coaching clinic that will be conducted by two coaches from Bulawayo. The session started at Gwanda Adventist Primary School from 2pm to 5pm and today the event will be held at Colleen Bawn club from 8am to 12pm. Gwanda Tennis Club coach Mtshutshisi Mathema said since the ‘revive tennis in Gwanda’ programe was launched last month, as a community, they seek to maintain the momentum and ensure the city registers itself as a force to be reckoned with in the sport. “On the second day (today) after having a session with the kids, we’ll have time with the members of the community in order to instill a strong culture of the game. Involving the community and the parents in particular is an advantage as it will promote a sense of collectiveness in empowering these youngsters. “Members of the public are invited to grace the occasion and assist us in any possible way. We kindly appeal to the parents to come and support the kids throughout the sessions,” said Mathema. The final day of the clinic will see a number of selected Gwanda Tennis Club players playing against participants from surrounding areas from 8am to 10am. Ever since Emakhandeni Tennis chairman Witness Jiyane donated tennis balls and rackets, the Gwanda community has never looked back in terms of promoting tennis and Mathema said the club will appreciate if other well wishers assist as well. Mathema said the association is looking forward to engaging local schools by ensuring that they host events of this calibre more often. – @DecoDecent2
