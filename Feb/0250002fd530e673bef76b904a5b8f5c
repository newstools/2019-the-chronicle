SOME Milton High School old boys have ploughed their resources into reviving their former school’s rugby by paying fees for a number of struggling but talented first team players. Former Milton High old boys; Vusa Mlingo, Rangarirai Midzi, Vusumuzi Ndebele and Nkululeko Robbi, among others, have adopted players whose parents are struggling to pay fees and appealed to other ex-Miltonians to chip in to help the school revive its former sporting glory. Eight out of 12 first team players identified by the school’s rugby coach Jafet Ndebele have their fees fully paid by the old boys and their names will only be made public when the other four have been covered. Jafet Ndebele hailed the old boys’ gesture. “A number of old boys volunteered to assist some of our players, especially those coming from the western suburbs, whose parents or guardians have been finding it hard to pay fees, but have potential to one day play professional rugby. We’re in the process of reviving our rugby and we’re grateful to those who have made sure that pupils have nothing to worry about, but concentrate on their studies and sports,” he said. “Milton has a great history in sports and last year we were on the map, but realised that we need to up our game. We want to uplift the school through rugby and the old boys are helping us secure the players we need to accomplish our goal. We’re optimistic that the future of our school’s rugby team is bright as long as all our players are taken care of. The initiative has boosted morale among the players. Two of our players will be going for trials at the Sharks Rugby Academy in South Africa.” — @DecoDecent2
