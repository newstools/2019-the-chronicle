AWARD winning Bulawayo filmmaker Daniel Lasker aims to take his career to a whole new level this year through his new film titled The Man, which he wants to expose to the international market. The Man, which Lasker produced and directed, is a story about two hired thugs who are tasked with disposing a body in a secluded forest. When the body turns out not to be deceased, they find themselves in over their heads. “There’s no official public release date for the film as of yet. The film has to attend the festivals first and then we’ll see what’s the best way forward is for releasing it. I’ve started submitting the film to multiple international film festivals which will take place throughout the year,” said Lasker. He explained how the film came about: “Through Facebook I connected with a very talented screenwriter from Los Angeles who had written a script for an interesting short film. I read the script and instantly loved it and knew I had to direct it.” The $250 budget short film was shot in a forest in Cape Town, South Africa and it took the filmmaker over a month to make with a week of preparation, three shooting days and three weeks of editing.
