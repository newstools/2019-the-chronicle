SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD Elizabeth Ndlovu from Maphisa Athletics Club is appealing for donations to enable her to attend a preparatory competition in Pretoria, South Africa, on March 13 ahead of her trip to the African Junior Championship next month. Ndlovu qualified to represent Zimbabwe in the 3 000m at the African Junior Championship to be held in Cote d’Ivoire from April 16-20. Eddien Sports Trust has launched a social media campaign to raise funds for her to attend the events. Well-wishers can contact the trust’s representative Sehliselwe Ncube on 0786056156 or 0774545764. “We liaised with the Maphisa Athletics Club to come up with fundraising ideas that work and ensure Elizabeth (Ndlovu) goes to South Africa as that will help her have a feel of what to expect in Côte d’Ivoire. She has shown undisputed talent and it’s the duty of the nation to rally behind the girl. I hope the strategy will be effective so that together we can assist her,” said Ncube. Ndlovu has been exceptional but lack of funding has been a major stumbling block to her budding career, as she couldn’t participate in a number of tournaments. Last month Ndlovu’s coach had to pay from his pocket for her to attend a qualifier for the African Junior Championship in Harare. — @DecoDecent2
