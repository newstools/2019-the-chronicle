The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma URBAN grooves pioneer Roki and Zimdancehall chanter Bazooka of the Kwedu fame are billed to perform at Comfort Pub and Grill in Victoria Falls this weekend. Roki, who recently dropped a new album, is on a quest to revive his shattered career which has been characterised by scandals. He will be performing on Friday. Bazooka on the other hand is a new kid on the block who will be making his debut performance in the resort town on Saturday. He will be playing his part in growing the Chillspot Records popularity and will be supported by DJ Phibz. Event organiser of both shows – Terminator Makoni – said preparations for the two events are at an advanced stage. “Preparations are on course with Bazooka enthusiastic about his first performance in the Falls. Roki on the other hand can’t wait to give his fans a surprise performance of his new tracks,” Makoni said. For Roki, the Victoria Falls show will be a moment to see if he still has support while for Bazooka it will be a platform for him to create a fan base in the resort town. – @mthabisi_mthire.
