The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter WIDE Awake Nursery School will host the 2019 Gymnastics Day for young children on September 27. The event will see children aged two to seven years taking part in the event to improve their strength, agility, coordination and physical conditioning. “Preparations have been going well. We are just making sure everything is in order. It is an internal school event and it is 1 hour 30 minutes long as we want to keep it as short as possible,” said Ruth Shumba, who is a teacher at the nursery school. For young children, gymnastics focuses on developing body awareness and love of the sport. Climbing, crawling and jumping are a gentle way for children aged two to three years to develop physical coordination and self-confidence. Physically demanding gymnastics moves such as tumbling, somersaults and cartwheels are introduced to children aged three to five years. From six to seven years, children are recommended to introductory gymnastic classes, moves such as handstands, flat backs, walks, turns and leaps on beams and so on. “The reason behind gymnastics is to keep their bodies healthy as well as improve self-esteem and confidence,” said Shumba.
