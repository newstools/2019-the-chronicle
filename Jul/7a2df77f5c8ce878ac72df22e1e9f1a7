The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A Bulawayo man has been arrested for allegedly possessing four elephant tusks. Peter Phosa (58) from Sunninghill suburb was allegedly found with the four tusks weighing 15 kilogrammes without a licence. Phosa yesterday pleaded not guilty to charges of possession of raw ivory when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Trynos Utawashe. In his defence, Phosa said the ivory was not his but was found in a car that he had borrowed. “I borrowed the motor vehicle to carry some maize from Kelvin industrial area and I didn’t search the car. I got into town and I gave it to my business partner Thomas Ndlovu to go carry maize too,” said Phosa . Mr Utawashe remanded Phosa out of custody to August 7 for continuation of trial. Prosecuting, Mr Jethro Mada said on April 2 at around 3PM, police were tipped off that Phosa was selling elephant tusks.Mr Mada said a follow up was made by police and rangers from Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority leading to Phosa’s arrest. “During the search, four elephant tusks packed in a white sack were recovered as well as a weigh scale and a tape measure,” he said. — @sharonbuwe
