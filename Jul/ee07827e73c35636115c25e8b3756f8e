The Chronicle Cape Town — Bafana Bafana coach, Stuart Baxter, was reportedly the fourth highest-earning coach at the ongoing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt. The Scotsman, now in his second stint (2004-2005) as the South African national coach, penned a deal in May 2017 until the end of the 2022 Soccer World Cup in Qatar. According to Soccer Laduma website, the 65-year-old earns a cool R980 000 (€62 300) a month from his contract with the South African Football Association (Safa). The highest-earning coach was, ironically, Egypt’s Javier Aguirre who earned R1.7 million (€108 000) before he was sacked following the Pharaohs’ loss to Bafana Bafana. Cameroon mentor and football legend Clarence Seedorf is reported to take home R1.5 million (€96 000) a month. Two-time Afcon winning coach Herve Renard earns R1.2 million (€80 000) for his services at Morocco while Gernot Rohr (Nigeria) pulls in R800 000 (€49 700) a month. South Africa were knocked out by the Super Eagles on Wednesday in a hotly-contested quarter-final that ended 2-1 at the Cairo International Stadium. Meanwhile, both semi-finals will take place on Sunday as Tunisia face off against Algeria (kick-off 18:00) while Senegal meet Nigeria (21:00 SA time). Top 10 highest-earning coaches at Afcon 1.
