The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A 34-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo breathed a sigh of relief after he was acquitted of attempted murder following a misunderstanding during a drinking spree. Dumisani Ngulube from Pelandaba suburb had been accused of ripping Mr Nkosiphile Ndlovu (21)’s stomach open with a machete resulting in his intestines spilling out. West Commonage magistrate Ms Sibongile Marodze said the State failed to prove that Ngulube stabbed Mr Ndlovu. “In coming up with the judgment, the court considered evidence that was presented and it’s clear that Ngulube didn’t commit the alleged offence. He’s therefore acquitted and discharged,” said magistrate Marodze as Ngulube shed tears. Prosecuting, Ms Samantha Bubede said on February 26 this year at around 3AM in Magwegwe suburb, Ngulube took Mr Ndlovu’s beer without his permission and a misunderstanding arose resulting in Mr Ndlovu being stabbed. “Ngulube pulled out a machete and the complainant and his friends ran away. However, Ngulube managed to catch up with Mr Ndlovu and stabbed him several times on his stomach,” she said. She said Mr Ndlovu’s friends heard him screaming and they immediately went to look for help. They found him lying in a pool of blood with his intestines protruding and they covered him with a jacket as he had lost a lot of blood. Ms Bubede said Mr Ndlovu was rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital where he was admitted for more than three weeks in the Intensive Care Unit. The prosecutor said Mr Ndlovu identified Ngulube at an identification parade, leading to his arrest. — @sharonbuwe.
