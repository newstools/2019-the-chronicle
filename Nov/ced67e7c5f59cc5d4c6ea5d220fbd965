The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A WOMAN from Bulawayo has been granted a protection order against her abusive police officer ex-boyfriend who assaulted her after she turned down his plea to rekindle their affair. At one point the cop allegedly armed himself with a gun and spent the night outside the woman’s door, threatening to shoot her if she did not reconsider the break-up. Ms Angeline Nyamadzi said she was living in fear as her ex-boyfriend Canaan Mukwiti, who is stationed at Ross Camp Police Station, habitually assaulted and threatened to shoot her for ending their relationship. She said her ex-boyfriend punched her when she was at work and embarrassed her in front of her friends. “The respondent has been forcing me to reconcile with him and I refused. He comes to my workplace every day looking for me and sends threatening messages. He also came to my place of residence at night looking for me and slept outside armed with a gun waiting for me. I now fear for my life as he can shoot me any time since he is still bitter about the break up,” said Ms Nyamadzi. “I pray that he stops following me, coming to my workplace and stops texting me.” Western Commonage magistrate Mr Urgent Mvundla granted an interim protection order prohibiting Mukwiti from assaulting, insulting and threatening his ex-girlfriend. The magistrate also barred the police officer from communicating with Ms Nyamadzi as he risked being jailed.—@sharonbuwe.
