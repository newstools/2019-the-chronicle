The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent WHEN music producer Jah Seed of Bongo Maffin started constructing stone houses at his rural home in Njanja, Mvuma (Mashonaland East) five years ago, little did he know he was tapping into a talent that had been lying idle. Despite being based across the Limpopo where he has been highly regarded as one of the best in that country, Jah Seed (born Adrian Anesu Mupemhi), never turned his back on his rural home. “Five years ago, after my grandmother’s house crumbled, I decided to rebuild it using 90 percent local material like rock cladding to hopefully strengthen and give it longevity so that it can be passed on long after we are gone. “I called on the services of locals to pick up stones around the area and, of course, I bought cement. I wanted to come up with something that would stand the test of time,” he said. At O-Level, the Dai Ndiri Shiri hit-maker studied building at Waddilove in Marondera before going on to pursue Construction Engineering at Bulawayo Polytechnic. But he never got the chance to use the engineering certificate as he went straight into music as Apple Seed before rechristening to Jah Seed. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-442850" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/jah-seed-home3-360x201.png" alt="" width="623" height="348" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/jah-seed-home3-360x200.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/jah-seed-home3.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px" /> This building experience, however, was to be used for the construction of a unique homestead for his family where he built huts using stones. The state-of-the-art huts are well equipped with solar power ensuring that the houses are well lit and have running tap water as well as a geyser. The solar also powers a submersive water pump which ensures there is running water at the homestead. Completing the set up is a 400 litre Jojo tank that is perched four metres high. Two weeks ago, years down the line after the homestead was built, disaster struck the province through Cyclone Idai which destroyed almost the whole Njanja neighbourhood, leaving many homeless. However, Jah Seed’s family home was not affected by the floods and he explained why. According to the renowned artiste, the houses in the area crumbled due to too much moisture as a result of the devastating cyclone. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-442851" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Jah-seed-home1-360x201.png" alt="" width="621" height="347" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Jah-seed-home1-360x200.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Jah-seed-home1.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /> “I was called and informed that our homestead was the only one left as most of our neighbours’ homesteads all crumbled due to Cyclone Idai effects. “Of course, I rejoiced in my heart that my family was safe after all, but I also sympathised with neighbours who had lost their property. The rock cladding I used for our homestead kept the moisture from rising or penetrating the walls and this is why it remained intact,” said Jah Seed. After noticing that their homestead was the only one standing, villagers from far and near Jah Seed’s family home have been calling the artiste and making inquiries on how to construct their homes. Some have been asking if he can construct such houses for them, an offer that has marked the birth of Dzimbadzemabwe Housing Project. “After someone posted the stone huts on social media, I received a number of calls from people who wanted similar houses. I got three calls on the first day and the number kept rising so I said ‘why not have a construction company’ which I’ve since named Dzimbadzemabwe Project,” he explained. “I think it was God’s way of saying I should use my other talent to serve my community. I’m ready to serve those who are victims of Cyclone Idai,” said the dreadlocked singer. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-442853" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/jah-seed-home-4-360x212.png" alt="" width="620" height="365" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/jah-seed-home-4-360x212.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/jah-seed-home-4.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /> Asked if he would be coming down to Zimbabwe to supervise the project, Jah Seed said he was planning on mobilising a team that will conduct business in the country. “I’m in the process of setting up a team that’ll be on the ground to assist our clients. We’re also designing a Do It Yourself (D.I.Y) mobile video which will be explaining stage by stage how to construct the stone houses. “It’s all about using available material and I’d like to believe stones are available everywhere in Zimbabwe. It’s unfortunate I cannot be there full time to personally supervise the project due to work commitments,” he said. Given the availability of stones and cement, Jah Seed said construction of one hut can take two to three days to complete. Turning to his music career, Jah Seed said he and his group — Bongo Maffin – are in studio where they are working on new music. “We’re working on a single and eventually we’ll drop an album. This weekend (today), I’ll be in Harare to support Selmor Mtukudzi at her concert.” Although they at times go separate ways to pursue solo careers, Jah Seed said Bongo Maffin was going nowhere and was now stronger than before. “Expect new things soon. We’re now bigger and stronger than before,” he said.
