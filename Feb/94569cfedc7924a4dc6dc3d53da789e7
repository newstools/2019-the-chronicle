LEGAL experts have advised Zesa Holdings to let an independent body to investigate the allegations of corruption at ZPC Kariba Football Club. Coach Godfrey Tamirepi and some top executives stand accused of duping the public entity for the past three seasons by inflating players’ signing-on fees. Lawyer James Makiya told our Harare Bureau that allegations of corruption in the parastatals should be investigated by an independent entity as the issue was of public interest. “If serious allegations emanate from a parastatal or organisation like the ZPC Kariba Football Club, there is need for the Government to set up an independent board to look at the issues surrounding the allegations. “There is no way a parastatal can have its own internal investigations as they will be compromised in terms of the issues to do with impartiality, fairness and the concept of natural justice will be violated. “That is because they will be doing it for themselves. But, with the independent board in place, definitely positive results will be obtained,” said Makiya. Another lawyer, who preferred anonymity, said that the issue needs to be addressed with urgency. “The impact and effects of conducting these issues without urgency and transparency is that it affects the investors and general public’s confidence in issues to deal with corruption. “Now that a press article was run concerning the corruption issue, and there seems to be no progress, there is need for the Government to formulate an independent committee that should look into the issue.”
