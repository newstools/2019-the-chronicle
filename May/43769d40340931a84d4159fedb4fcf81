The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondent President Mnangagwa will launch this year’s national Culture Week at the Glamis Arena in Harare on Saturday. After the national launch, the celebration of diverse cultures being held under the theme ‘African Royalty – Our Heritage’ will be held in all the country’s provinces. National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) acting communications and marketing manager Catherine Mthombeni said preparations for the celebrations are on course. “Preparations for Culture Week commemorations are on course in all provinces. Some of the activities that will be paraded at the official launch include a cultural procession, music and dance performances, fashion show, art and craft exhibitions                                                                            and herbal medicine exhibitions,” said Mthombeni. She said this year’s theme was a celebration of being Zimbabwean. “The week-long programme’s theme is ‘African Royalty – Our Heritage’. The theme is a clarion call to everyone to pay homage to the Zimbabwean way of life which is espoused through the food we consume, our language, our arts and our traditional leadership. “The uniqueness of Africa’s heritage is akin to royalty which in itself is a birthright. Zimbabwe is home to many diverse ethnic groups, cultures and languages and thus, possesses a rich and varied tradition, history and heritage,” said Mthombeni.
