AN improved performance by the Zimbabwe women’s cricket team saw them wallop Namibia by eight wickets in the second clash of the five-match Namib Desert Women Twenty20 Challenge played at Sparta United Club in Walvis Bay yesterday. The win saw the Mary-Anne Musonda captained Lady Chevrons go two nil up in the T20I series after they won the first match at the same venue by six wickets on Saturday. Namibia batted first and posted 77 runs for the loss of six wickets in 20 overs with the highest score for the home team being an unbeaten 37 by opener Adri van der Merwe. Precious Marange and Anesu Mushangwe took two wickets each. <img class=" wp-image-431862" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Chipo-Tiripano-getting-her-Player-of-the-Match-award-360x210.jpg" alt="" width="699" height="408" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Chipo-Tiripano-getting-her-Player-of-the-Match-award-360x210.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Chipo-Tiripano-getting-her-Player-of-the-Match-award.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /> Chipo Tiripano getting her Player of the Match award In response, Zimbabwe made 80-2 in 11.2 overs, former captain Chipo Tiripano top-scoring with 31 not out, an effort good enough to see her win the Player of the Match award while skipper Musonda was second best with an unbeaten 24.
