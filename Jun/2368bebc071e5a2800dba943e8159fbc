Mrs Banana was the country’s first First Lady after independence. “I’m happy that I’ve visited the former First Lady today. To me she’s a mother. I used to follow her work during the time she was First Lady. I was young at the time and I admired the way she carried herself and conducted her duties as First Lady. “She was a humble, quiet and loving woman who had so much respect for people. People admired her. I cherish the guidance she gave to the people of Zimbabwe and I pray to God to keep her healthy,” said Amai Mnangagwa.
