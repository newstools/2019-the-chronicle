The 17th annual indaba was held at Mzingwane High School, Esigodini, in Matabeleland South province in December last year under the theme: “Zimbabwe Is Open For Business: Peace, Unity Towards An Upper Middle-Income Economy By 2030”. More than 5 000 delegates from all provinces attended the conference. The conference consolidated national efforts towards reviving Zimbabwe’s economy with President Mnangagwa aggressively pursuing quick economic recovery through implementation of the Transitional Stabilisation Programme (2018–2020). The TSP is premised on fiscal consolidation, economic stabilisation, and stimulation of growth and creation of employment. The party came up with a number of resolutions which included that President Mnangagwa was the sole Zanu-PF Presidential candidate in the 2023 elections. The party also reaffirmed its position on zero tolerance to corruption.—@pamelashumba1
