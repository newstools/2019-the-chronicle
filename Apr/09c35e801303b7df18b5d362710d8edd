The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter Talen Vision 1-0 Bosso 90 BOSSO 90 goalkeeper, , produced stunning saves as his team narrowly lost the Southern Region Division One Soccer League match to Talen Vision at Luveve Stadium yesterday. It was a game where the young Muza drew point-blank saves frustrating the championship hopefuls, whose goal only came in the last five minutes of the game when substitute Adrian Banana capitalised from a miscue by Bosso 90 defender Nkosana Ndlovu, to tap the ball into an empty net. Muza did his best to deny ex-Harare City forward Grey Kufandada a goal in a one-on-one situation in the second minute and in the second half he went airborne to tip the striker’s effort for a corner kick. The Bosso 90 goalkeeper’s saves even won the admiration of Vision coach, Mkhuphali Masuku. “In these early season games, what is important is to grind a result and you could see that this was anyone’s game where the opposition came to the party as well. “Their goalkeeper made numerous saves that were match telling, but we maintained our composure and fought till we got that late goal. Credit to my players for being patient and fighting for maximum points. “Bosso 90 appeared to be content getting a point but we wanted a win which we got,” Masuku said. The victory temporarily takes Vision to the top of the table with nine points from three games, a position they are likely to lose this afternoon should former Premiership side, Bulawayo City, beat Binga Pirates in Binga. Despite losing yesterday’s encounter, Bosso 90 remained third on the table with six points. Bosso 90 assistant coach, Gift Lunga (Junior) praised his charges for a good show and is hopeful they will bounce back to winning ways. “It is a painful defeat in the sense that we did everything to at least get a point but that mistake by Nkosana made a difference. “We won’t crucify the boy because he played his heart out in defence and mistakes are part of the game. “We will not lose hope because of this defeat, it’s just a minor setback. We will continue competing effectively while developing our boys because we are not under any pressure, but it is our opponents who are under pressure,” said Lunga. With City travelling to Binga this afternoon, the other pick of the weekend is the ZPC Hwange versus Casmyn game at the coal mining town. ZPC Hwange are among title contenders and a victory today will take them to three points adrift of table toppers. A potentially explosive encounter is on the cards in Plumtree where Mainline FC will be searching for their first victory of the season when they play host to Toronto FC. Southern Region Division One
