The Chronicle A pregnant 13-year-old girl killed herself after being gang-raped by up to six men and held captive in a flat, it has been claimed. The teenager is alleged to have snapped a photo showing her legs dangling from a roof and sent it to a friend with a message saying: “I’m about to go, I love you.” The girl also wrote a series of Facebook posts reading “I’m about to go” and “If I wasn’t pregnant, I would have gone a long time ago”, it was reported. Her mother, who reported the alleged attack to police in Bangkok, Thailand, said it had sent her into a deep depression before she died by suicide last Friday. The girl, identified publicly only by her nickname, Pinkie, jumped to her death from a block of flats just before midnight, Thai media reported. It is claimed she had rowed with her 45-year-old mum shortly before she died. The mum ran after the girl and tried to stop her, Thai media reported. The girl apparently found out she was pregnant about a month before her death. Her mum had told police that a gang of men had held her daughter captive and raped her on the night of November 11, Coconuts Bangkok reported. Police told the news website they had identified two suspects, but reports claimed up to six men were involved in the attack. Royal Thai Police said they had arrested one man on an unrelated gun offence during a raid on his home. Officers were searching for a second man. Spokesman Krissana Pattanacharoen said: “Both suspects face charges for collaborating to sexually abuse the girl. “There were two girls, two boys on the night of the incident. One of the girls, Pinkie, is dead. Warrants have been issued for both boys.” — The Mirror
