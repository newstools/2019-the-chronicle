The Chronicle Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter A 42-YEAR-OLD man has been fined $30 for exposing his privates to two minors. Jabulani Moyo appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi who fined him $30 or five days in prison. He pleaded guilty to a public indecency charge. The magistrate asked him why he acted in that manner. “I just wanted to check if my manhood was still functional,” said Moyo. The court heard that Moyo exposed his genitals to his 11-year-old neighbour and her sister. They reside at Khishi Squatter Camp, Trenance in Bulawayo. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said on April 13 this year at around 8PM, the minor was in her room with her younger sister when Moyo knocked at their door. “The child asked Moyo why he was knocking at their door that late and he said he wanted to sleep,” said Mr Mageza. The court heard that Moyo was drunk. The minor together with her sister chased him away using sticks and ran back to their room. Moyo went back outside their room and exposed his privates and said things that the complainant did not hear. “The 11-year-old minor managed to run away and inform the siblings’ older sister who confronted Moyo. “Moyo ran away as soon as he heard their sister’s voice,” said the prosecutor. — @gwizi_n
