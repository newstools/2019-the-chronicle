Ndlovu (15) completed the junior women’s (Under-20) category 6km race in 25 minutes 08.12 seconds. The other athletes who made podium finishes were silver medalist Privilege Chikara (16) of Mashonaland Central, who completed the race in 25 minutes 08.90 seconds, and 18-year-old Faith Nyathi, the only runner from Team Bulawayo to land a medal. Nyathi from City Meats Athletics Club crossed the line in 25 minutes 47.88 seconds. Bulawayo took a small squad of 10 runners to the National Cross Country Championship after senior men’s athlete Thando Maphosa pulled out at the 11th hour. The other Bulawayo athlete in the junior women’s category (Under-20), Yvonne Mutare (18) of Ihlosi Athletics Club finished a distant eighth in 31 minutes 13.21 seconds. Bulawayo had three representatives in the junior men’s (Under-20) 8km race, with Sparrows’ Freedom Banda the best placed after finishing fifth, while Disciple Ncube of Ihlosi finished in 11th place. ZRP Fairbridge’s Michael Chimhuka failed to complete the race. Godwin Katakura of Mashonaland Central won gold in the junior men’s event, crossing the finishing line in 28 minutes 05.55 seconds. Christopher Denga of Midlands finished second in 29 minutes 01.35 seconds, while Harare’s Golden Mhonderwa won bronze in a 29 minutes 35.65 seconds. Bulawayo had no representative in the senior women’s category in which all medalists were from Harare. Rudo Mhonderwa won the 10km race in 39 minutes 02.39 seconds, followed by Caroline Mhandu in 40 minutes 37.02 seconds, with Patience Murowe grabbing bronze. Three members of the senior men’s team, ZRP Fairbridge’s Ngonidzashe Ncube, Sparrow’s duo of Danford Mlilo and Dumo Mkhwananzi failed to complete the 10km run. Independent runner Xolani Ncube finished eighth, clocking 36 minutes 05.85 seconds, while veteran runner Trust Chidomaya, who doubled as Team Bulawayo coach, managed 13th position in 37 minutes 25.89 seconds. The top three runners in the senior men’s category came from Harare. Canicious Nyamutsita won gold in 33 minutes 52.19 second, with the silver medal going to Moses Tarakino (33 minutes 52.20 seconds), while Tatenda Hove took third place in 34 minutes 11.00 seconds. Team Bulawayo coach Chidomaya blamed high temperatures for his athletes’ shortcomings. “We could have done better, but the temperatures were very high resulting in some runners failing to complete the race. The senior men’s event’s start was delayed and only kicked off just after midday. I think if we had trained in anticipation for high temparatures, we would have done better,” said Chidomaya. — @ZililoR
