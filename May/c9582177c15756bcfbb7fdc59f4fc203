The Chronicle ZIMBABWE have named an experienced side for the ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019 that gets underway in Harare on Sunday. Led by captain Mary-Anne Musonda, the squad of 14 includes her predecessor Chipo Tiripano as well as veteran Precious Marange. Another ex-skipper Sharne Mayers, who missed Zimbabwe’s tour of Uganda for a triangular series also involving Kenya earlier this month, has made the cut at the expense of Christabel Chatonzwa. Right-arm seamer Chiedza Mzembe, who claimed two wickets in her international debut against Namibia in January, is the youngest in the home side squad at 17 years. Zimbabwe, who have won all of nine Twenty-20 international matches they have played this year, will go into the ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019 carrying the favourites’ tag. Their biggest challenge is likely to come from Uganda, who toppled Zimbabwe for the first time to win the last regional qualifier tournament in Windhoek, Namibia, in September 2017. The nine-team ICC Women’s Qualifier Africa 2019 is a Twenty-20 competition serving not only as part of the pathway for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup to be held in Australia in 2020, but will also help decide participants in the next 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup to be staged in New Zealand in 2021. Zimbabwe are in Group A with Tanzania, Nigeria, Mozambique and Rwanda, while Uganda, Kenya, Namibia and Sierra Leone make up Group B. Old Hararians Sports Club and Takashinga Cricket Club will host group matches, while Harare Sports Club is the venue for the final.
