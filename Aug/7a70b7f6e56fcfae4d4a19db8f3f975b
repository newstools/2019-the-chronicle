The Chronicle Cape Town — Manchester United forward Alexis Sanchez could still depart the club before the close of the European transfer window, with Juventus said to be leading the chase for his signature. The Chile international has endured a difficult spell at Old Trafford since his high-profile move from Premier League rivals Arsenal. Injuries and poor form have seen Sanchez drop down the pecking order at United and, with the player on some of the biggest earnings at the club, the Red Devils could be tempted to allow the 30-year-old to move on. The former Udinese star has been attracting plenty of interest from Italy, with Juve believed to be leading the chase. However, the Old Lady will face stern competition from other clubs in Serie A, with AC Milan, Inter Milan and Napoli also thought to be monitoring Sanchez’s situation in Manchester. — Sport24. New third kit for United Manchester United and Adidas have officially released their third playing kit for the 2019/2020 season. The minimal design celebrates United’s first FA Cup win in 1909, in which the club beat Bristol City 1-0, thanks to Sandy Turnbull’s goal, to lift the trophy for the first time. The team adopted a Lancashire red rose crest on that final shirt 110 years ago, and the unique rose print incorporated on the new third kit in understated grey and black tones pays homage to this historic victory — Sport24.
