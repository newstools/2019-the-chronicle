The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter IN an effort to advance the development of athletics in the district, a Tsholotsho politician and businessman Melusi Ndebele has formed the first ever athletics club in the district. An off shoot of Tsholotsho Pirates Football Club, the new athletics club will be known as Tsholotsho Pirates Sports Academy and so far has 10 athletes. “We have Tsholotsho Pirates netball Queens which is two-years-old. Now we have incorporated this new sport code. So far we have 10 athletes because of limited resources but we want to accommodate more,” said Ndebele. He said his desire to bring national, regional and even world attention to Tsholotsho in terms of sports pushed him into forming the new club. “Talent is abundant here and its not right for such talented athletes to compete during the first term only when they partake in schools competition. We want them to compete throughout the year and even organise some competitions as Tsholotsho which will also market our area,” said Ndebele. He said their first competition would be tomorrow at White City Stadium at the Bulawayo Athletics Board’s track and field athletics competition. “Iziqholo ZeZhwane will be at White City Stadium on Sunday (tomorrow) competing in their first competition and I am positive that we will leave a mark but again if we don’t do well we shall not despair,” said Ndebele. Since they are based in Matabeleland North, Ndebele said they shall soon be affiliating to the relevant athletics provincial body.
