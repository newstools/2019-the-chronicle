The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter After the successful hosting of Miss Tourism Midlands this past weekend, the search is now on for Matabeleland North’s tourism ambassador. Auditions for the models will be held this weekend at Invuvu in Victoria Falls with the Matabeleland North province set to hold its finals at the same venue on June 29. Event organiser, Shauntel Nkomo called on aspiring models to attend the auditions on Saturday and Sunday. “All potential models from the province (Hwange, Lupane, Bubi, Binga, Tsholotsho and Nkayi) are being invited to come through for the auditions which will start in the morning on Saturday and Sunday to stand a chance of representing the region at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe national finals taking place in Harare in September,” Nkomo said. She said those from outside Victoria Falls will be catered for as there are some well-wishers who have pledged to accommodate them. “We’ve set aside two days for the auditions in order to accommodate those coming from outside Victoria Falls. We hope they come through as we’ve made a provision for their accommodation. “We’re, however, calling on the Victoria Falls and Matabeleland North community to come forward with whatever they can as we want to uplift each other in our community,” she said. Nkomo said those attending the auditions should come dressed in black jeans, white vests and heels and should bring national identity cards. “Aspiring models should be between 18 and 24 years old, not married and never been pregnant. They should be cleared by their parents or guardians and be at least 1,67metres tall.” – @ncubeleon
