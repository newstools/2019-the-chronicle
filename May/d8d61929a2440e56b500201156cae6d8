The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter IT was not a good outing for The Venue and Filabusi United, as they both lost their games in the Zifa Central Region Division One League on Sunday. Filabusi United were thumped 4-0 by Gweru-based correctional services side Whawha to leave them third from the bottom and still without a win from seven outings. The win was Whawha’s third of the campaign and took them to sixth place on the league table with 11 points. Apart from Kwekwe United, Filabusi United is the only team yet to collect maximum points after drawing four matches and losing the rest. The Venue were unlucky to lose 1-2 at home against Gwanda-based Vumbachikwe Mine. With one win and a draw out of seven matches, The Venue are now tied on four points with neighbours Filabusi. There were high hopes when the two sides were promoted to the second tier league, but they have been finding the going tough and are languishing in the relegation zone. Sheasham FC top the table with 19 points and are yet to lose a match, while Blanket Mine and FC Platinum Under-19 are tied second on 14 points.
