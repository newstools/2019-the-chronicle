The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief THE Minister of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Cde July Moyo, has said he is going to look into the issue of the suspension of Gweru Town Clerk, Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza, as a matter of urgency to make sure that service delivery is not affected. The Minister said he wasn’t briefed about Ms Gwatipedza’s suspension by the MDC Alliance-led council on Tuesday. “About the suspension of the Gweru Town Clerk, I’m not aware of it. I wasn’t briefed about this alleged suspension and I’m going to look into it,” he said. Announcing the suspension of Ms Gwatipedza at Town House on Tuesday, Gweru Mayor Councillor Josiah Makombe said the Town Clerk had been suspended with immediate effect with no pay. Clr Makombe said Ms Gwatipedza faced a number of allegations which include failure to co-ordinate, monitor and supervise all departments which affected service delivery. He said council was prejudiced financially due to her dereliction of duty. “Gross incompetence: council is greatly concerned about your continuous failure in discharging your duties diligently and effectively as expected resulting in council failing to properly operate. Gross insubordination: council on several occasions requested that you avail your contract of employment and those of your directors to which you have refused, failed and neglected to do so. As a Mayor I have also written to you and you have failed to respond or avail the contracts,” said Clr Makombe. Without elaborating, Clr Makombe said Ms Gwatipedza also violated the Public Procurement and Debt Management Act.
