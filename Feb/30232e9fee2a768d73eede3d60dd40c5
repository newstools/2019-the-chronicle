GIANTS ended Mavericks’ unbeaten run with a 67-56 win in the Bulawayo Basketball League at Khanyisile Sports Centre on Saturday. Mavericks went into the game with a two-point lead over Giants and were hoping to increase their lead to four points, but Giants had other ideas. Giants now top the league table by virtue of a superior head to head although they are tied on points with Mavericks. Giants’ coach, Emmanuel Mukandi, said before the match his charges were aware that the best result for them was a win. “It was a tough game, but we led from the beginning until the last minute, which shows our hunger for retaining the championship. Being the defending champions automatically makes you the team to beat, so the plan was to start well,” said Mukandi. “Two new players that we signed from Highlanders added value to our game and improved the team’s mental strength. We want to win every match from now on and we’re looking forward to the second round of the season because we want to represent the province at national level.” Highlanders B beat Oilers 80-63 to cap the men’s weekend fixtures. Mavericks women played the game of their lives to beat Lakers 56-51. Results Men: -Mavericks 56-67 Giants -Oilers 63-80 Highlanders B Women: -Mavericks 56-51 Lakers
