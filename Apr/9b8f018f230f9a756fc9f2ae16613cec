The Chronicle BEITBRIDGE Town has in the last decade been rapidly developing into a modern medium city in line with the Government’s thrust to achieving sustainable urban development. However, like any place transforming within the urban renewal initiative the town has its own fair share of problems. Our Beitbridge Bureau Chief Thupeyo Muleya (TM) speaks to former Beitbridge- Mwenezi Town Board Councillor, Mr Enos Mabidi who served in the local authority during the colonial era. Mr Mabidi reflects on the challenges he faced working under a white-dominated local authority and how he physically fought a white administrator after a dispute over prioritisation of projects in black suburbs. He also speaks on the town’s growth since Independence: TM: Who is Enos Mabidi and how did you find your way into a white-dominated Beitbridge-Mwenezi Town Board? EM: I was born in Beitbridge town (69 years ago) and my father used to work at the District Administrators’ office’s policing section. The only time I was out of Beitbridge was when I went for secondary education at Manama High School. I started working at Manica Zimbabwe (Beitbridge) in 1973, that’s when the government established town boards. Beitbridge was the last one after Chiredzi. I joined the Beitbridge-Mwenezi Town Board in 1978 on a four year term. There were no elections at that time. Myself and other black councilors were chosen through consensus to represent people in the western suburbs (where blacks lived) under the town board. This was in consultation with the residents. TM: What were your roles as a black councillor in a Rhodesian Town Board? EM: We were trained on local governance by one Mr Makwati who was based in Harare. Rhodesian Town Boards were composed of whites and blacks. The blacks were mainly responsible for what was known as locations (westerns suburbs). We were responsible only for the administration of the townships divided into sections now known as wards. Mr Makwati helped us understand the constitution of the Town Board, rules and regulations and the administration matrix. TM: What powers did a black pre- independence councilor have? EM: It was not easy. Imagine there were two elephants fighting. The black elephant didn’t have skills or horns. In fact it was not walk in the park, but we managed to achieve certain goals. For example we didn’t have the control of the finances and were only told that the revenue generated was only that from the Beer Hall Fund (now as Machembere Bar). This had a separate bank account and the funds were allocated to us to meet our obligations including upgrading roads and public lighting among other key structures. However, we didn’t have a bigger population by then. During that time we didn’t have power per se except that we carried the voice on behalf of the residents on problems they had. We would present these to the Town Board Secretary Mr Bishop and Mr Roth (then Treasurer). TM: How did the then local authority plan on service delivery, particularly on settlements, education, health, economic and infrastructure development? EM: As I have indicate, our allocations came from the Town Board’s Beer Hall Fund. This had a separate account from all other revenues for services, taxes and water. With the help of Mr Makwati, we engaged on a programme to grow the townships and uplift the living standards for the people. We drew a plan to build a primary school, houses for residents, street lights, shopping centre and a second beer hall. In most cases council deliberations ended up in fights. At some point I exchanged blows with the then Treasurer Mr Roth over the disbursement of revenue under the Beer Hall Fund for the township projects. I was suspended from the council meetings for three months over that incident. However, I am not ashamed that eventually we managed to put together the people’s desired projects. We built Dulivhadzimo Primary School, Mashakda Business centre, core-houses, street lights and road surfacing though these were diverted to start in what was called the town. <img class="size-medium wp-image-445872" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-16-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-16-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-16-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-16-680x529.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Former Beitbridge-Mwenezi Town Board Councillor, Mr Enos Mabidi speaks in the interview TM: How were service delivery priorities in terms of racial lines? EM: Though we got money from the Beer Hall Fund, the white community, the majority of them were commercial farmers with the financial muscle. They were getting taxes from Beitbridge and Mwenezi farms. You will note that they had the upper hand on resource allocations than the Town Board residents. TM: When you look at Beitbridge’s current development pace is it corresponding with the demand for services and growth of population? EM: No it’s not. The town is developing at a faster pace but authorities cannot provide services. There are poor water and sewer reticulation facilities and bad roads. There are also issues poor or lack of storm water drains. In addition, if you go along Wamlala stream (which cuts across the town) you will notice that that stream is ever flowing with raw sewer. We are sitting on a health time bomb. There is a need for proper urban planning versus the demand of water and sewer reticulation facilities and other amenities. TM: How can the council improve on local governance and service delivery issues? What’s your advice? EM: I know there is a problem of finance, probably their revenue base is not enough to meet their commitments. However, we must not be complacent and say we don’t have money. We should consider private public partnership with other players. For instance on the provision of potable water, I have a very big plan (drawn in 2002) to bring water to the town from Zhovhe Dam (63km West of Beitbridge). This plan if properly implemented may bring water to the town just under six or 12 months. Zinwa and Agritex have been reluctant to take it up. I am prepared to show them the areas which will help improve our situation. It involves bringing water through smaller rivers and small dams (i.e Giraffe Dam) along the way, which would then feed into the main storage points in the town. Of course we have heard about the construction of a canal for that purpose, but the progress on the ground points to a project that will take eternity to bear fruits. The current method which is being used to deliver water from Zhovhe through Umzingwane River is very wasteful and takes at least three weeks before water gets to Beitbridge town. I have also read in the newspapers that Zinwa intends to hand over the running of water affairs to the municipality. This will work a great deal to address perennial water woes. TM: What calibre of councillors does Beitbridge or any other town need, in your view without focusing on politics? EM: Without delving into politics, one feels the current crop of councilors is not visible except during election time. During our era we used to have sub committees at ward level and these are the people who collaborated, sat with residents of the particular area and wrote down the problems they faced. This was done quarterly and yearly. The councilor of that particular ward would then report to the main Town Board on their issues. This system helped address issues as and when they arose based on consultation. Councilors from the black community would also convene meetings with residents minus the white communities on pertinent issues. We would also tour the whole town regularly to acquaint ourselves with the situation on the ground rather than rely on mere reports. In short we need hands-on councillors, who live with the people, share experiences and are committed. It appears currently we have very complacent people. TM: If invited for another term, what would be the first thing you would do in Beitbridge? EM: I will start with addressing the problem of water and sewer. I will also find ways of raising revenue for the town’s capital projects in consultation with the residents and not dictate to them. We must have a shared vision. Residents must be told of the problems they are facing. We need to keep people in the know so that they actively participate in matters concerning them. It’s important to present people with problems and the dangers ahead so that they understand and support whatever initiatives the council wants to roll out. Ask them how to raise revenue. You cannot wake up and say we are levying this and that there is no money. We can’t keep digging our graves without solutions. Let’s involve all the brilliant minds we have to build our town and not look at one’s color among other things. TM: Currently Beitbridge Municipality is collecting under 40 percent of its target revenue due to an upsurge in defaulters. What can be done to boost revenue collection? EM: Defaulting is a major problem we have nursed for a long time. So it also needs a long time to be resolved. As I indicated, we need to get the people involved in addressing their challenges. TM: Post Independence, Beitbridge has transformed from a growth point, district council, town and municipality, what are your comments on the progress thus far? EM: We have been developing this town with the left hand and not the right hand. What I mean is, we concentrated in building residential accommodation without industry. That’s one aspect why our revenue base is diminished because there is no industry where we can generate money from. Let’s invite businesses to build industries in Beitbridge to generate money. For example in my plan to draw water from Zhovhe is great or if the Government would build a prison at Zhovhe and involve the inmates in farming, definitely we will create a greenbelt to boost agriculture development. We also need to invite national brewery to Zhovhe where there is plenty of underutilised water. Also that brewery would create a market for small grains (millet and sorghum) farmers. There are a lot of avenues we may use to boost revenue and create industry. We can’t have a town growing aloof from the industry sector. Currently we have border jumping and cross- border businesses. In any case these don’t employ anyone. There is plenty of water to power industries and develop our town. In my own view let’s put a stop on issuing un-serviced housing land. TM: What role do you think central Government should play in assisting Beitbridge realise its potential? EM: There should be increased monitoring and evaluation of local authorities by government. There are a lot of things that are amiss and we seem to be very complacent, for instance the issue of water is perennial and it must be addressed urgently. TM: How can Beitbridge municipality benefit from its proximity to the country’s and Sadc’s busiest border. EM: The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development must assist Beitbridge in building and maintaining its road infrastructure and water facilities. We are a transit town carrying the transit burden. At the moment the local authority is going it alone and it’s not sustainable. TM: Service delivery around health and education facilities remains a challenge in the town. What do you think should be done? EM: Revenue base remains a challenge and the only way out is to engage in partnerships with businesses and development agencies. But this needs us to take up the initiative and be innovative, let’s not be crybabies. TM: Currently local authorities are looking at twining agreements/arrangements to boost urban renewal. What is your advice to Beitbridge? EM: It’s high time authorities at Beitbridge and their partners translate their agreements on the ground. We can no longer have a business as usual approach of signing documents after which we file documents and fold hands. Let’s transform agreements into action. TM: Have you tried approaching authorities at Beitbridge to offer assistance in addressing some cross cutting issues. EM: I have tried several times and have been rebuffed. I think we need to look at ideas collectively than personalities. -Feedback: tupeyo@gmail.com <mailto:tupeyo@gmail.com>
