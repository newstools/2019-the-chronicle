The Chronicle Mukudzei Chingwere, Harare Bureau FORMER Warriors coach Charles Mhlauri says Zimbabwe football is being left behind by the pace of changes happening elsewhere in the game. The dreadlocked mentor, who is now based in the United States, said while progress has been made, the pace was not in line with what was happening elsewhere. “I can safely say we are far behind in that regard, the game, as you know, is trying to go forward but we are moving at snail’s pace, if we are moving forward (at all). “For me I can safely say we are far behind and it is really sad for us because we have so much talent, there is no clear plan, other countries it is clear from the districts, provinces to the national teams and I am not seeing that. “I think there is a lot we need to do to get a clear strategic plan from the cell to the national teams, we need to develop in terms of infrastructure and junior football,” he said. The former Caps United gaffer is in the country to attend to some personal issues and has been watching training sessions as well as some matches in the country. He was part of the crowd at Barbourfields in Bulawayo when FC Platinum ended their Caf Champions’ League group stages campaign with a defeat. “I think, as a country, we have a lot to do to be more competitive,” said Mhlauri. “Everything comes back to our junior development, you can measure in terms of results, it is not difficult to tell. “We have not gone into the quarter-finals of the African Cup of Nations in the few times we have been there and that explains it. “The Champions League, we need to be counted among the best, there is still a lot to be done.”
