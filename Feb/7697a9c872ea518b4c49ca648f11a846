THE Bulawayo Metropolitan Karate Association (BMKA) will send a 45-member team to the Dominican Convent Clash of the Titans Inter-Schools Karate Tournament scheduled for Harare on Saturday. BMKA secretary-general Samson Bhuza said they were hoping to bring home several medals from the junior karatekas’ national event. The tournament will involve boys and girls’ categories in both Kata (form/display) and Kumite (fighting) competitions, with participants being grouped in age groups of 7-9 years, 10-11 years, 12-13 years, 14-15 years, 16-17 years and the Under-21s. “This is an important competition for young and upcoming karatekas as they would be able to gauge how they fare against their compatriots at national level. “The athletes are drawn from BMKA’s affiliate school dojos (training schools) Falcon College, St Thomas Aquinas Primary, Dominican Convent High, SOS Children’s Village, Coglan Primary and Baines Junior,” said Bhuza. Some of the karatekas that make up the team include Ruvarashe Makokowe and Anotida Bhuza in the 7-9 years girls’ section, with Cliffson Moyo and Sibusiso Mabunda representing the boys in the same age group.
