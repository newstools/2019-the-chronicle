The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda, in Johannesburg, South Africa
FC PLATINUM skipper Petros Mhari is excited by his call up to the national team for the crucial African Cup of Nations clash with Congo-Brazzaville on 24 March at the National Sports Stadium. Mhari is one of three goalkeepers named by Warriors’ coach Sunday Chidzambwa in his provisional squad for the match, with others being South African-based George Chigova and Edmore Sibanda. The 31-year-old Mhari has over the years been ignored for national duty, but Chidzambwa has finally given him a chance. “It’s really exciting as a player to be recognised and called up to the national team; it encourages you to keep working hard,” said Mhari. He is, however, not expecting to be in between the sticks for the big game and is content with just being part of the squad. “I don’t want to put myself under pressure by thinking about being the first choice. I am happy just to be part of the squad.” Mhari has produced some brilliant saves in his team’s four Caf Champions League group stage matches and it seems Chidzambwa called him up based on those performances. FC Platinum could have conceded more than the five goals they have let in so far had it not been for Mhari’s exploits. — @Mdawini_29.
