It is alleged that on a date unknown but during the month of June, the accused allegedly visited the complainant at her residence in Mkoba 16 suburb in Gweru,” said the source. Pastor Magondo allegedly asked the complainant to accompany him to Mkoba 14 suburb. “They got into the accused’s vehicle. However, along the way, Pastor Magondo allegedly told the complainant that he wanted to go to the grinding mill in Mkoba 12 before going to Mkoba 14,” said the source. “It is said that the accused and the suspect drove to a secluded place near Mkoba 12 light industrial site.” The source alleged that Pastor Magondo proposed love to the complainant who turned him down. “The suspect allegedly forcefully grabbed the complainant and raped her once. The matter was reported on December 19 since the complainant was being threatened with death in the event she reported the man of cloth,” said the source.
