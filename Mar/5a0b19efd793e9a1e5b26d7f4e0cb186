THE pulse of the Great Dyke, Ya FM radio station that broadcasts from Zvishavane (frequency 91.8), has increased its coverage with those as far as Kwekwe now able to access the station. The interactive radio station that has been operating since 2015 recently set up two transmitters in Gweru with the Mberengwa one nearing completion, to increase its coverage and attract more listeners. As a result, as from yesterday, those in Gweru, Kwekwe, Chivi, Lalapansi, Chiwundura and parts of Gokwe started receiving transmission on frequency 101.9. Ya FM chairman Munyaradzi Hwengwere said they were targeting predominantly mining communities as the station has positioned itself as the voice of miners and the pulse of the Great Dyke. He said the Great Dyke and the Midlands province in particular was a potential economic enabler and therefore the need for the radio station to increase its presence and coverage. He said they were now working on the Mberengwa transmitter whose frequency will be 94.7. “We’ve started with two transmitters, one we’re putting at Mberengwa Peak to cover the whole of Mberengwa up to Gwanda and another one at Guinea Fowl to cover Gweru, Gokwe North and South, Kwekwe and other areas,” he said. “After we’ve installed additional transmitters, we must be able to cover more areas like Insiza, Gwanda, Chegutu and Masvingo.”
