The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya in Beitbridge ORGANISERS of the third edition of the Beitbridge Mayor’s Half Marathon say they are targeting 500 athletes for the event. The half marathon, which seeks to bring awareness against littering and pollution, had 130 people runners in 2018. Beitbridge Municipality spokesperson Raniel Ndou said preparations started early this year to enable more athletes to register. “This year we started our preparations early and we look forward to a bigger and better event. Our target is 500 athletes. “The event will be held on the 8th of June, a day after the National Clean Up day as you are aware that the main objective of the marathon is to raise awareness against litter,” said Ndou. “Our sponsors remain Sanctuary Insurance Company. We have activated the organising committee and registration is now open. “Registration is at Beitbridge Municipality main building and at our housing offices in Dulivhadzimo suburb. We are also looking to open more registration points. We encourage people living with disabilities to take part in the event. Last year we only had five participants,” said Ndou. He said entry fees had been pegged at R20 for adults and free for all school children. Adults should produce national identification documents when registering, while children need to bring their birth certificates. Categories on offer are the juniors (16-20-year age group), open (20-39) veterans (40-49) and masters (50 years +).
