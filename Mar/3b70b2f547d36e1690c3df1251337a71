The Chronicle Cloud Fusire, Harare Bureau THE ZPC Kariba supporters committee have come out with guns blazing calling for the immediate resignation of the club’s chairperson, Fadzai Chisveto, and the executive members, saying their appointments were unconstitutional. The committee members, who preferred anonymity, said that they want the recent appointments of Chisveto and committee members – Robert Mamvura and Gwinyai Dzorani – nullified. The supporters vowed to boycott all the club’s home games until their grievances are addressed. “We have been quiet and patient as supporters, watching our club’s constitution being abused all the time,’’ the supporters said. “The first key resolution made by the committee and supporters is to call for the immediate resignation of chairperson, Fadzai Chisveto, and her executive members. “The club’s constitution clearly stipulates that elections shall be held at an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting called for the purpose of electing the executive. “We are in the process of writing letters to the PSL and ZIFA as we want their intervention to nullify the appointments of the executive and allow the elections to take place.’’ The supporters group also saluted the leadership at Manica Diamonds for the way they dealt with corruption allegations. “We applaud the Manica Diamond management for being transparent and taking action against those fingered in corruption scandals by suspending them to allow for investigations,’’ the fans said. “Our club has a similar case but the accused coach and the executive members are at their jobs like nothing ever happened.’’
