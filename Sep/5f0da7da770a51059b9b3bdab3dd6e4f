The Chronicle Cape Town — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has allayed fears over the injury suffered by Sadio Mane on Sunday, saying it was nothing more than a dead leg. The in-form frontman, who has scored six goals this season, hobbled off in the second half at Stamford Bridge on Sunday with the problem, which was two-fold. “It was a knock on the bone, around the knee, and a dead leg — that’s an awful combination,” Klopp said. “He tried everything, but I think you saw, there was one counter situation when he really tried and I would say on a non-dead-leg day he will get that ball, but no chance. “And then we say, ‘Come on, now we have to do it’ and changed. That’s it.” Goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Roberto Firmino earned Liverpool a 15th Premier League win on the bounce and restored their five-point lead over Manchester City. Alexander-Arnold’s opener was superb as he fired a free-kick into the top corner from the edge of the area for his first goal since November last year. “Hendo (Jordan Henderson) wanted it at first and then I think he thought it was a bit too close for him,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports. “I discussed with Mo (Salah) that I wanted it rolled to make the angle a little bit better and maybe confuse the goalkeeper a little bit, and I’ve been able to put it away. “I thought it was too close to go over the wall, I didn’t know if the wall was going to jump so I couldn’t go under it, I had to go ‘keeper’s side. “It was a good roll and I just tried to put it as hard as I can that side with a bit of placement.” — Sport24.
