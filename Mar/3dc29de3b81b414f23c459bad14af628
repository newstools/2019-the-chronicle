The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Victoria Falls RENOWNED athletics coach and trainer Kenny Nyape has hailed Mosi oa Tunya High School in Victoria Falls for breaking new ground to become the first school in Matabeleland North to have a standard athletics track in the province. Speaking on the sidelines of the province’s joint primary and secondary schools inter-district track and field competitions that kicked off here yesterday, Nyape, one of the best athletics brains in the country, said it was wonderful that the school’s authorities had decided to invest in the facility. “I haven’t seen any school in the province with a standard track. This is really commendable and it will go a long way in uplifting the standard of athletics in the province. Our athletes have long been disadvantaged when it came to bigger competitions because they will be meeting a standard track for the first time,” said Nyape. He said minor improvements that are needed like ensuring the track, which is a cinder track, is level will be done with time. “As you can see that in some areas the track is not level, but I think those are minor things that will be worked on later,” said Nyape, who has nurtured a number of award winning athletes in the country from his days at Bulawayo’s Sprinters Athletics Club up to the time he joined Hwange Colliery Company. Prior to the new standard track at Mosi oa Tunya High School, the province only competed on a standard field if the competitions were not being hosted in Hwange town that has a proper field owned by the coal mining company.
