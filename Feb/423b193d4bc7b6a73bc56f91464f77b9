ZIFA Central Region held an induction workshop for new teams in the Central Soccer League to apprise them on the league’s operations. Zifa Central Region board member in charge of marketing, Pithias Shoko, said they expect all teams to be professional and not pull out before the season ends. Chrome Stars withdrew from the league after playing a few games citing financial constraints, forcing the league to compete with 12 teams. “It is also important that clubs adhere to the Fifa club licensing system. The system governs your operations and also controls movement of players from one team to another,” said Shoko. A total of 16 teams will make up the regional league, among them Zvishavane-based FC Platinum U19, MSU FC, Whawha FC, Gwanda’s Blanket Mine, and Vumbachikwe FC, The Venue FC from Maphisa, Nembudziya-based Gokwe North FC, ZPC Munyati, Real BVM, Sheasham FC and Shabanie Mine FC.
Filabusi will also play host to CRSL games after Filabusi FC came along. Gweru dominates with the most teams in the CSL, with Kwekwe providing three teams, after the introduction of Kwekwe United and Dendairy to join Ivan Hoe Mine. Tongogara FC will not be part of the league after being banned for causing post match chaos on the last day of the 2018 season. Tongogara were fined $15 000 and will be only be considered back into the league after 2 seasons on the sidelines. The post-match violence resulted in the CSL losing their sponsor ZG Medical Aid, saying their brand can’t be associated with violence. The Central Soccer League announced after its annual general meeting early this month that all clubs should submit their squad lists on or before the first day of February.
