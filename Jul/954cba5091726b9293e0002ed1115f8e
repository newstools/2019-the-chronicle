The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter A Canadian-based philanthropist Collin Nyabadza has donated sports equipment to several schools in Bubi district through his Children’s Voice Charitable Trust (CNCVCT). Nyabadza, a former teacher at Tjewondo Primary School in Maphisa, Matabeleland South province, is driven by the desire to empower the rural child to bridge the gap between them and urban children. The consignment consists of soccer boots and kit, which will also be distributed to schools in Bulawayo, Imbizo, Matobo, Tsholotsho, Umzingwane and Mutasa districts. Reusable sanitary pads for girls are also part of the donations. Somvubu Secondary School and Majiji Primary School in Bubi were the first to receive donations yesterday. “The soccer boots and balls were donated by the community of Swift Current city where I live in the province of Saskatchewan and also by communities in Calgary, while the reusable sanitary pads were donated to us by Days for Girls, a Canadian charity based in Saskatoon,” said Nyabadza. “Some of the equipment was donated by Grade 4 learners at Ecole Centennial School in Swift Current where I work. The donated equipment which included school supplies and some cash will be handed to schools affected by Cyclone Idai.” Last year CNCVCT collaborated with two British charities to donate 50 000 books to 42 primary and secondary schools as well as two local universities. The organisation is also in the process of building a classroom block at Sishawe Primary School in Bubi. — @innocentskizoe
