FC PLATINUM have boosted their squad ahead of the crunch Total Caf Champions League Group B opener against Orlando Pirates next week by snatching up Soccer Star of the Year finalist Godknows Murwira and Perfect Chikwende from Ngezi Platinum and Bulawayo Chiefs respectively. The two attack minded players will be perfect replacements for the departed duo of Winston Mhango and Rodwell Chinyengetere who were part of the Zvishavane miners in the preliminary and first round stages of the tournament. Mhango has found new home at Zambia’s Kabwe Warriors while Chinyengetere joins Baroka United in the Absa Premiership. “We have brought on Murwira and Chikwende on an initial one year contract which will be reviewed at the end of that period,” said Pure Platinum’s media relations officer Chido Chizondo yesterday. Pure Platinum had three slots after they registered 27 players for the African Safari but with Chinyengetere and Mhango slots not replaceable, it meant that Norman Mapeza would have been left with 25 players to choose from, barring any unforeseen eventualities like injuries and or suspensions during the campaign. They got their preparations for the group stages underway yesterday in the Midlands but will be shifting to their Caf games base, Bulawayo early next week. “The team comes to Bulawayo early next week,” said Chizondo.
