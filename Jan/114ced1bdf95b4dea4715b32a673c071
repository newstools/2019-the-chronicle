THE new Zifa board rang changes to the senior and Under-23 men’s technical teams saying they are setting a trajectory that they are embarking on. Bongani Mafu and Tonderai Ndiraya bounced back into the Warriors technical team as assistants to head coach Sunday Chidzambwa who survived the chop. Ndiraya and Mafu replaced Rahman Gumbo and Lloyd Mutasa. Emerging from a meeting with the Warriors and Under-23 technical members, Zifa vice-president Gift Banda who is in charge of all national teams, said the technical changes are meant to bridge the gap between the Warriors and the Under-23s who are headed by Ndiraya. “The Zimbabwe Football Association confirms the changes of the senior and Under-23 national teams technical set ups as follows; Sunday Chidzambwa remains the senior national team head coach, with the first assistant coach being Bongani Mafu and the second assistant is going to be Tonderai Ndiraya. Team manager remains Wellington Mpandare, Eddie Chivero comes in as the liaison officer, with Maimba Mapuranga being the protocol officer. Brenna Msiska remains the goalkeepers’ coach. “The Under-23 technical team members are head coach Ndiraya, first assistant Mandla Mpofu, second assistant Lizwe Sweswe, goalkeepers’ trainer Tembo Chuma and manager Chivero. “The Warriors and the Under-23 have taken precedence because they will be more active this year,” said Banda. “These changes have been necessitated by the fact that we realised that none of the senior team assistants were on the Under-23 structures, meaning that the conveyor belt of promoting Under-23s to the first team had been broken. This is a new trajectory for us as the new board,” said Banda. He allayed fears of disturbing Warriors 2019 final Afcon qualifier against Congo in March. “The appointment was done in consultation with the head coach and we believe that the guys coming in will add value and complement the coach,” said Banda. — @ZililoR
