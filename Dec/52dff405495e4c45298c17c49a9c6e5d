The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau FARMERS in Beitbridge have lost 4 548 cattle worth about ZW$27, 3 million due to drought according to local Agritex office statistics. Traditional leaders in the district have appealed to Government to provide tractors to till the land for many smallholder farmers who lost their draught power due to drought. An estimated 15 000 people are in need of food aid in the district. Beitbridge district is a drought prone area where animal husbandry and irrigation farming are the main source of livelihood for communal farmers. Speaking during an annual traditional leaders interface held a Chief Matibe’s (Elisha Mbedzi) cultural court recently, the community leaders said most people relied on cattle for draught power. They said most cattle were too weak to be used as draught power. “We are in the middle of a devastating drought and people are hopeful that we will have good rains for cropping. “What is worrying is that most families have lost cattle and now need to be assisted to prepare land for planting,” said Chief Matibe. He said the people were therefore appealing to the District Development Fund (DDF) to provide tractors for tillage.
