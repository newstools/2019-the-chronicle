The Chronicle Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) Midlands Chapter has appealed to Government to ban exportation of crude tar and scrap metals for the benefit of the local industry, which is being starved of raw materials. Delivering his speech at the CZI elections recently held in Gweru, past CZI president, Mr Mike Dzinoreva, said there was a need for Government to save the local industry through banning exports of those materials, which have left the industry bleeding. “The Midlands chamber continues to lobby Government to ban the export of crude tar and scrap metal to the detriment of local manufacturers in these value chains including Zimbabwe Chemical Refineries (ZIMCHEM) and Midlands Metals respectively,” he said. Mr Dzinoreva said local steel companies could also benefit if the ban was effected. “Local companies stand to benefit a lot from crude tar and scrap metals because there won’t be any need for them to import raw materials from other countries. The local industry is currently running on about 10 000 tonnes of scrap metal per month against its monthly requirements of 27 000 tonnes meaning they have to import the remaining 17 000 tonnes,” he said. Mr Dzinoreva said there was a need to add value to scrap metal as opposed to exporting it with little rewards. “Local manufacturing industries can add value to scrap metal and produce various tools for the mining, farming and other sectors. So, if implemented, various sectors stand to benefit a lot from this scrap metal, which is being sold for a song,” he said. Last year, the Zimbabwe Institute of Foundrymen (ZIF), said banning of scrap metal exportation could revive the country’s foundry industry and enhance its contribution to various sectors of the economy.
