The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FAVOURITISM and kickback allegations have resurfaced in the Zimbabwe Referees Committee southern region despite both the Premier Soccer League and the Division One League season being in its infancy. Disgruntled referees on the Division One panel are up in arms after some referees from the PSL list were handed matches in the second tier league. “How do we improve ourselves when PSL referees are also assigned Division One games on a weekly basis,” fumed one referee. Three referees that have already handled PSL games this season have also featured in the opening two weeks of the Zifa Southern Region Division One games. Blessed Mpande, who was a shock appointment as a fourth official in the blockbuster encounter between Highlanders and Caps United at Barbourfields Stadium, was recently in charge of the Ajax versus Indlovu Iyanyathela game, while Saneliso Sibanda, who was an assistant referee in the equally explosive Chicken Inn versus Dynamos match at Barbourfields Stadium was on the line again when Bulawayo City took on Mosi Rovers at the weekend. Prince Mathumo, who was the fourth official when Bulawayo Chiefs took on TelOne, has handled two Division One games, (Talen Vision versus Makomo and Bosso 90 versus Moto Moto). “We can’t rule out kickbacks from these appointments, especially to one over glorified former referee who is believed to be calling the shots,” said another referee. According to the referees’ fees schedule, a PSL referee gets $270, the same amount given to a fourth official while assistants get $240. Division One referees receive $100, with their assistants getting $80 and that means Mathumo has to date been the biggest benefactor with about $470 in the three games he has officiated in. Efforts to get a comment from John Mtero, who handles referees’ appointments in the Southern Region, hit a brickwall as his mobile phone continuously rang unanswered yesterday.
