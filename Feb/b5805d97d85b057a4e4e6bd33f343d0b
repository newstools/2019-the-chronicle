HIP Hop musician, Cal_Vin, says he wants to grow his fan base by hosting his “Unplugged With Cal_Vin” shows in other cities and towns. The first show has been slated for the Bulawayo Theatre on Saturday and will kick off at 5PM. Cal_Vin of the Zikhuphan’ fame has been on a mission to prove that Bulawayo artistes have what it takes to host shows that are attended by a paying audience through his one-man shows that have generally been well attended. With his Unplugged shows, he is taking his quest a step up as he will be performing acoustic music. “I plan to take the “Unplugged shows with Cal_Vin” nationwide. Firstly, I’ll take them to Matabeleland to places like Victoria Falls, Plumtree, Hwange and Gwanda and then the next stop would be the Midlands. “All these are part of efforts to grow my fan base,” Cal_Vin said. “The Unplugged shows with Cal_Vin are all about being independent and growing my fan base and brand at the same time. Gone are the days where as Bulawayo artistes, we’d have to wait for Harare artistes to come and perform in Bulawayo so that we open up for them at shows. “We need to start doing our own things and not to always wait for the promoter’s call.” The rapper said many artistes from Bulawayo should start trying to host their own shows if they want to grow their brands and be respected in the music industry. “Many artistes are afraid to start doing their own shows, but I want to advise them to just do it. I have done independent shows before and most of them flopped, but we need to learn from those experiences.” His Unplugged show on Saturday is pegged at $10 and will have various supporting acts including Bryan K, Tiff Cake from Kwekwe, Thami Khumalo, Lee Mchoney and Oktopus. “I hope the masses will turn out this weekend because with maximum support from the people of Bulawayo, our music will grow immensely,” said Cal_Vin.
