The Chronicle THIS is the first time Zimbabwe are facing UAE in a one-day international since the Asian side ended their chances of qualifying for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019 during the qualifier last year. Overview Zimbabwe v United Arab Emirates 1st ODI (Harare Sports Club today) Four months into the calendar year, Zimbabwe are set for their first international of 2019. They have spent a good five months off the road. However, despite the lay-off, regular captain Hamilton Masakadza has been ruled out with a thumb injury sustained while playing domestic cricket, while wicket-keeper Brendan Taylor tweaked his hamstring at the 2019 Pakistan Super League. That has paved the way for the inclusion of two uncapped players in their 16-man squad for the first two games: Left-arm spinner Ainsley Ndlovu (23) and 20-year-old off-spinning all-rounder Tony Munyonga. Timycen Maruma has been called back after an extended period on the sidelines. UAE, by contrast, have been quite busy leading up to this series. They began the year with a limited-overs series against Nepal, to whom they lost both the ODIs and T20Is 1-2. But they bounced back from that to win a two-match T20I series against United States of America 1-0. They also played one-day games against USA and Lancashire. Now, they are set to play in their first bilateral ODI series against a Full Member. UAE will welcome the return of Rohan Mustafa, their former captain, who, along with Ahmed Raza and Rameez Shahzad, had been suspended for eight weeks. Raza and Shahzad, though, found no place in the squad. UAE will continue to be led by Mohammad Naveed, who had filled in for Mustafa during the home series against Nepal and the T20Is against USA. Shaiman Anwar and Mohammad Usman will also bolster the side, being two of their most experienced players. Zimbabwe haven’t won an ODI series at home since October 2015. But UAE don’t have much experience in these conditions – they were last in Zimbabwe for the CWC Qualifier and won against the hosts by three runs. This is the home team’s chance to capitalise on their inexperience and set the record straight. <img class="wp-image-444519 size-medium" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-8-257x360.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="360" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-8-257x360.jpg 257w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-8-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-8-486x680.jpg 486w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-1-8.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /> Zimbabwe Squad facing UAE Key players Sikandar Raza (Zimbabwe): The all-rounder gives Zimbabwe valuable runs in the lower middle order, and his off-breaks are critical to imposing restraint through the middle overs. He is also capable of chipping in with crucial cameos under pressure. Shaiman Anwar (United Arab Emirates): The top-order batsman is experienced and a proven commodity. With 1107 runs, Anwar is easily UAE’s most prolific ODI batsman. They will look to him to pull them through tough situations and put up competitive                               totals. Conditions Only thrice in the last 10 first innings at Harare Sports Club has the score exceeded 250. Conditions are expected to be sunny for the most part. Squads Zimbabwe: Peter Moor (c), Solomon Mire, Brian Chari, Regis Chakabva (wk), Sean Williams, Timycen Maruma, Sikandar Raza, Donald Tiripano, Kyle Jarvis, Tendai Chatara, Chris Mpofu, Craig Ervine, Brandon Mavuta, Ainsley Ndlovu, Tony Munyonga, Elton Chigumbura United Arab Emirates: Mohammad Naveed (c), Rohan Mustafa, Ashfaq Ahmed, Shaiman Anwar, Muhammad Usman, CP Rizwan, Chirag Suri, Muhammad Boota, Ghulam Shabbir, Sultan Ahmed, Imran Haider, Amir Hayat, Zahoor Khan, Qadeer Ahmed. — ICC.
