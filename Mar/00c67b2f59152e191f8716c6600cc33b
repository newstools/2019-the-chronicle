The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Premiership sides, Highlanders and Chicken Inn will tomorrow clash in a competitive friendly match as they seek to tie up loose ends before the start of the 2019 season. The two sides will face off at Barbourfields Stadium. Both teams head into tomorrow’s game having had contrasting pre-season preparations, with the Gamecocks having had a free-flow programme while Highlanders have been crippled by a players’ strike over salaries. Chicken Inn will be playing their fourth competitive pre-season friendly match, following three games that they had in Malawi last week. For Highlanders, this is their first competitive pre-season encounter, which they would have loved to play with a full strength side and parade all their players for the new season. Highlanders had nine first team players training with them during the week, as other players sat out at home. The number of senior team players that have been training with the Bosso development side likely to feature against the Gamecocks tomorrow are goalkeeper Wellington Muuya, defenders Bukhosi Ncube, Vincent Moyo, national Under-20 captain Andrew Mbeba and Charlton Siamalonga. <img class=" wp-image-431834" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Madinda-ndlovu2-680x351-360x186.jpg" alt="" width="974" height="503" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Madinda-ndlovu2-680x351-360x186.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Madinda-ndlovu2-680x351.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /> Madinda Ndlovu Newly signed winger Cleopas Kapupurika who joined the club from Dynamos, striker Prince Dube, midfielder Mbekezeli Sibanda and striker Russell Chifuraare will be paraded by coach Madinda Ndlovu.
