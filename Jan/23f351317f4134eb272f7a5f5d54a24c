POLICE in Matabeleland South have launched a manhunt for two suspects who killed five cattle in the province. The first unidentified suspect, who used wire snares to trap four cattle, fled from the scene and is still at large. The incident occurred at around 10 AM on Saturday at Nyandeni Farm in Matobo District. The cattle belonged to Mr Biggie Dube (66). Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele said the suspect escaped as villagers attempted to apprehend him. “The suspect fled from the scene and is still at large. We are appealing to anyone who may have information on the suspect to contact police,” he said. Chief Insp Ndebele said in a separate case, a cattle rustler is on the run after he killed a beast in Gobatema village in Guyu. After killing the beast in Gwaringa grazing land, the unidentified suspect was found by villagers with the carcass in Zhokwe, about 20KM away from the grazing land at around 6AM on Saturday. Chief Insp Ndebele said the suspect also fled from the scene, leaving the carcass behind. In another incident, the police spokesperson said a suspect, Patrick Khumalo (62), was arrested after he trapped a cow and buried it in a shaft to evade arrest. This incident occurred at around 8AM last Thursday at Basini area in Fort Rixon. “The suspect, who had allegedly dug the shaft for mining activities, buried a cow that fell into the pit to avoid arrest. “We advise miners to avoid digging too close to villages as the shafts are risky to people and livestock. They must also always ensure they leave their shafts covered,” said Chief Insp Ndebele. — @winnie_masara
