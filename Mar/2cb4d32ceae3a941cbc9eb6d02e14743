The Chronicle Whinsley Masara, Chronicle Reporter TWO robbers in Beitbridge gave themselves away when they tried to sell property they stole from a woman to her husband. One of them was arrested while the other fled from the scene and is at large. The robbers pounced on Ms Sifelani Dube (37) of New Stands in Beitbridge whom they robbed of a handbag that contained two smart cellphones. A few minutes later, the suspects approached the victim’s husband at his work place, Topic Investments premises, where they attempted to sell him the stolen cellphones. Security guards at the scene apprehended Itai Tambarare (29) of Chamunanga village, Chief Sitaudze, and handed him over to the police. His accomplice, whose name could not be established, fled. The incident occurred at around 1PM last Thursday. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele said the incident occurred along the road while the woman was walking from Topic Investments to her home. “The victim had gone to give her husband, Mr Nkosikhona Siziba, some food at his workplace when the incident occurred. “The victim met the two suspects who confronted her and one of them grabbed and pushed her to the ground. He stepped on her neck while the other suspect took her small bag. The two suspects fled from the scene leaving the victim lying on the ground,” said Chief Insp Ndebele. The victim returned to her husband’s workplace where, after narrating her ordeal, the couple agreed to wait until her husband knocked off. Chief Insp Ndebele said after a few minutes, one of the suspects arrived at Topic Investments and tried to sell the cellphones to Ms Dube’s husband. “On identifying the cellphones, Mr Siziba went behind one of the buildings where he alerted security guards and they apprehended the suspect,” he said. Chief Insp Ndebele appealed to anyone who may have information on the whereabouts of the other suspect to contact their nearest police station. – @winnie_masara
