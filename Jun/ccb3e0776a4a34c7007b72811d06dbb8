National Arts Council of Zimbabwe Masvingo provincial manager, Helen Mudefi said preparations for the finals were at an advanced stage with the participating groups ready to showcase their talent. “Our preparations are at an advanced stage although our venue is bit small. The 10 groups have confirmed participation at the event being sponsored by Delta Beverages,” said Mudefi. She said the arts extravaganza whose main objective is to identify and nurture talent, is expected to start at 11.30AM. It will be graced by members of the Zimbabwe Tradition Dancers Association (ZTDA). “We urge everyone in Zaka and other parts of Masvingo province to come and celebrate traditional dancing with us,” said Mudefu.
