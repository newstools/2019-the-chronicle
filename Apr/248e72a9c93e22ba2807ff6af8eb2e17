His target is to compete for three more years before retiring. “I am really delighted to defend my title; a big thank you to the sponsors for their support, they should continue doing so. “I arrived in Bulawayo on Thursday and got some rest until today for the show. “I believe that my diet and cutting out water for four days ensured I was drier than the others,” Dlodlo said. From Bulawayo, Dlodlo is heading to Gaborone, Botswana, for the Designer Physique on Saturday where a number of Zimbabwean bodybuilders are expected to compete. <img class=" wp-image-447361" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Kylie-MacDonald-and-Lynette-Tom-stage-360x270.jpg" alt="" width="796" height="597" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Kylie-MacDonald-and-Lynette-Tom-stage-360x270.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Kylie-MacDonald-and-Lynette-Tom-stage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Kylie-MacDonald-and-Lynette-Tom-stage-680x510.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Kylie-MacDonald-and-Lynette-Tom-stage.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /> Kylie MacDonald and Lynette Tom stage Kylie MacDonald of Body Works swept the women’s bikini fitness ahead of Lynette Tom from Harare.
