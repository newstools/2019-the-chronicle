Presley Mabhena, who has been training Bulawayo’s representatives, said they had prepared well for the games. “We’re going for a big national event on the South African athletics calendar and hope our representatives will do us proud. We held qualifying competitions where these 40 athletes were selected to compete in different age groups ranging from Under-9s to Under-19s,” said Mabhena. “The SACSSA annual track and field championships are a Christian value themed event by schools affiliated to the SACSSA organisation. The Zimbabwean delegation will be headed by Benson Chauke from Naaz (National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe) and team manager, Mrs Gray from Celebration School.”
