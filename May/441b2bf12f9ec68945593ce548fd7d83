The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter FILABUSI United extended their winless streak to eight games after playing to a stalemate with fellow league debutants The Venue in a Central Soccer League encounter at home on Saturday. Filabusi have only scored one goal in the process in their 1-1 draw with league anchors Kwekwe United in the second game of the season. The Godlwayo side has drawn five times and lost thrice, leaving them second from the bottom of the log and in danger of returning to the second tier league. Neighbours, The Venue, have the same points with Filabusi after winning one and recording two draws. The Venue coach, Admore Sibanda said the draw was fair to both teams, but feels his team missed an opportunity to capitalise on Filabusi’s failure to score goals. “We desperately needed a win, as it was going to take us out of the relegation zone. It isn’t good to start fighting for survival before we’re halfway through the season. “The club has a clear objective; which is to avoid relegation and the boys are looking forward to gaining experience and I’m optimistic that we’ll find our form,” said Sibanda. He said their approach to the match was different and they had hoped things will turn out well. “I think we showed some improvements, especially on the defensive aspect, but we still have to work on our finishing. Our opponents were desperate for a win and they did show some intent to hit us on the counter, but we managed to contain them.” Weekend Results -FC Platinum Under-19 0-0 Kwekwe United -Filabusi 0-0 The Venue -ZPC Munyati 1-1 MSU -Dendairy 1-3 Ivan Hoe Mine -ZRP Gweru 3-4 Shabani Mine -Black Eagles 0-1 Gokwe North -Sheasham 0-1 Whawha -Vimbachikwe 2-1 Real BVM — @DecoDecent2
