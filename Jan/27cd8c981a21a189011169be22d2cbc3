THOSE who missed the heart wrenching docu-series Surviving R Kelly that premiered in America at the beginning of this month will have a chance to watch it as DStv will from next month show it on Crime+Investigation (channel 170). After premiering in America on January 3, some lucky enough to have Internet access watched snippets of the documentary on YouTube and live feeds on numerous Facebook pages. Unfortunately, Surviving R Kelly is not on NetFlix. According to a post on the Crime+Investigation Facebook page Surviving R Kelly will start showing on Wednesday, February 6 at 8PM, with a double episode. Thereafter single weekly episodes will be aired until the final episode on March 6. The six episode series includes more than 50 interviews with victims and people from R Kelly’s inner circle, revealing new allegations about the sexual, mental and physical abuse they’ve suffered. People interviewed include his ex-wife Andrea Kelly and Kitti Jones as well as musicians like Chance the Rapper, R&B singers John Legend and Sparkle. Since it aired, Lady Gaga has apologised for working with Kelly in the past; both Gaga and Celine Dion have removed their Kelly collaborations from streaming services. This was due to a global campaign called #MuteRKelly which has seen other streaming sites such as Spotify and ITunes removing the king of R&B’s music from their playlists. He has reportedly been dropped from his record label RCA under Sony Music. In Zimbabwe ZBC’s Power FM has removed his music from their playlist while other radio stations in the country such as Star FM, ZiFM and Skyz Metro FM have taken a wait and see approach. While in South Africa SABC is considering its options. The beleaguered singer has denied the allegations. Ever since release of the docu-series there are two investigations underway, one from Chicago as far back as 2017 and the other in Atlanta based on the documentary.
