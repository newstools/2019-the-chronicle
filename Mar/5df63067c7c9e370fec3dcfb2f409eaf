The Chronicle Sports Reporter CHICKEN Inn coach, Joey Antipas,is upbeat ahead of the 2019 season tomorrow. The Gamecocks will host ZPC Kariba at Luveve on Saturday. “We have prepared long and hard and we are just about getting there,” said Antipas. “We have been training for days on end but without playing competitive football so we are looking forward to the start of the season. “The Malawi trip was good, it helped us in many ways, especially with the bonding, since we have new players who needed to blend in with the old. “We played three games in a space of four days and I think that helped boost our match fitness,” said Antipas. Champions, FC Platinum, will get the ball rolling tomorrow when they face Harare City in a tricky match at Rufaro.
