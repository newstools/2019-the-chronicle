The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma Gwanda residents will be treated to a street bash and beauty pageant on Friday in the town’s CBD with a host of artistes set to perform. Dubbed the Block Party, the street bash that will be held along 6th Avenue will run concurrently with Miss Nest Gwanda to crown the face of The Nest pub and grill. Gwanda’s finest ladies will take to the ramp with the winner set to pocket R1 000 while her first and second princesses will walk away with R500 and R250 respectively. At the pageant, people will be entertained by DJ Mzoe, Virus, Nicksoul, RaAngie, Brandon and Ngobese. Organiser of the two events Tomang Pindi said all was in place. “All is in place for the block party and pageant. This will be the first ever street bash in Gwanda so the town’s residents should come prepared to party till they drop,” Pindi said. For Independence Day celebrations tomorrow, a Miss Easter Gwanda pageant will be held at Gwanda District Club. Ten models from Bulawayo will give the town’s models stiff competition at the contest where five male models have also been included to escort the female models. Gwanda’s high rising house music artiste Zhezhingtons, GDA Fire and Khoi Khoi will provide entertainment. –@mthabisi_mthire.
