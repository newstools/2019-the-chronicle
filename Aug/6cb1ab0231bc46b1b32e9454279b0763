The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau The provincial leadership in Matabeleland South has started working on a raft of measures to roll out devolution to grow the province’s economy which is anchored on mining, farming, tourism and energy, a Minister has said. In a recent interview, Matabeleland South Provincial Affairs Minister Cde Abednico Ncube said they have since held a successful indaba with key economic players in the province to come up with a plan of action. He said the programmes will be classified under short, mid and long term. Cde Ncube said the province had received $2,7 million for various capital projects that are being running in all its local authorities. “We successfully hosted a devolution conference on the 28th of February 2019 as a sensitisation strategy,” he said. “This conference also drew in multiple investors who were not privy to Mat South investment opportunities. Our local authorities also received funds to assist in district projects. The province abounds with investment opportunities in farming, mopani worms, livestock production, tourism , mining, energy and we also have key borders with Botswana and South Africa where economic activities are high.” The minister said with proper planning the province can reap more fruits in terms of irrigation-based farming considering that it has many water bodies to sustain such initiatives.
