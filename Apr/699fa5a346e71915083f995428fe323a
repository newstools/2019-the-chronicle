The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THE Zanu-PF stand at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) is a must visit stand as it portrays various beautiful artefacts in fashion and sculpture that speak to the party’s ideological grounding. Situated in Hall 5 at the exhibition centre, the Zanu-PF stand is eye catching. Predominantly green in colour, the stand looks more improved compared to what it was last year. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-447169" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Zanu-PF-stand-360x212.png" alt="" width="713" height="420" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Zanu-PF-stand-360x212.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Zanu-PF-stand.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /> It projects various departments that are in the party and blends information technologies with traditional artefacts. The spacious stand has adequate room for people to move around and the designers of the stand were obviously informed by the large numbers that have in the past passed through the stand. This year, in line with the Government’s mantra of ‘Zimbabwe is open for business’, the party’s exhibition took a business approach. One of its unique sections is the office of the First Lady which is in the form of a hut structure, perhaps showing how down to earth she is. This also showcases the culture of ubuntu that Zimbabweans are known for. What is also striking about this stand is the way the party is promoting the arts through showcasing some sculptures among other artefacts. The party this year also took the opportunity to market the party regalia and on display are caps, shirts, T-shirts and wrappers.
