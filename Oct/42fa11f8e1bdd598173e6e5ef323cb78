Vela was approached by Wilson Phiri who told him that the complainant was the one who had damaged the vehicle sometime in August 2019. “Vela and Gumede with the assistance of Phiri manhandled Mabhanga and they shoved him into their motor vehicle and drove away with him to Gumede’s place of residence. They tied his hands with a rope,’’ she said. Miss Mutukwa said Vela and Gumede went on to assault Mabhanga with a hammer on the face before taking $30 from his trousers’ pocket.
