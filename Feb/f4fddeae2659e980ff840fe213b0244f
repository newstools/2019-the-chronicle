The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter THE second edition of the unHeard series will be held next month at Ster-Kinekor cinemas in Bulawayo with South Africa-based digital strategist, Tendai Luwo, expected to attend. Hosted by Paper Bag Africa, the unHeard series that was initiated last month is aimed at bringing together experienced/successful personalities in industries like entertainment, sport and business to have one-on-one interactions with individuals who follow their works. The first edition last month was graced by successful Zimbabwean Hollywood TV host, Makho Ndlovu, who shared her media experiences. Luwo, who has previously worked with M-Net on programmes such as Idols South Africa and The Voice Nigeria, has vast knowledge in social media strategies, digital media consultancy as well as writing. Paper Bag Africa creative director Gilmore Tee said those who are interested in telling authentic African stories and the digital space are being invited to attend and get the opportunity to interact with Luwo. “Our aim with this series is to make sure people engage intimately with the people they look up to in their specific areas of specialty. This time, we’re hosting the talented creative director and digital strategist Tendai Lowu who is based in South Africa. We hope those who’ll attend will gain a lot from this experience,” said Gilmore Tee. He said the bio-monthly conversations would continue throughout the year.
