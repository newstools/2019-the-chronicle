Police have warned parents against roping in minors in protests after some hooligans used children below the age of majority as shields during violent demonstrations that were instigated by the MDC-Alliance last week. In an interview, Chief police spokesperson Commissioner Charity Charamba said children were involved in looting, acts of arson, and violence. “Parents should not allow their children to participate in violence. In some cases, violent protesters would use children as human shield when they clashed with the security forces. “Women would be placed on the second row while the violence architects, who appeared to be men, would be at the back. “That is dangerous and is tantamount to exposing children to violence. It also destroys their future,” said Comm Charamba. According to police statistics, at least four juveniles appeared in court in Mutare and Harare over offences committed during last week’s violent scenes. However, Comm Charamba said out of respect of the children’s rights, the juvenile suspects had to be released into the custody of their parents when the adults were locked up in remand prison. Two were released at the Harare Magistrates’ Court on Monday while another pair of juveniles was granted bail in Mutare. “We respect children’s rights and there was no abuse in the arrest of the juveniles. Unfortunately, our law does not exempt the juveniles from arrest. They had to be released into the custody of their parents,” she said. The police said some women with babies strapped on their backs committed offences during the protests. Video evidence, Comm Charamba said, showed some teenagers bragging over stealing alcohol. “Some video clips circulating on social media show a teenager bragging over stealing Glenfiddich whisky from Choppies supermarket in Mabvuku. “He will definitely be arrested for theft,” she said.
