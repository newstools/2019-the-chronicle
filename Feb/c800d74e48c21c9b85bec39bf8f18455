The Chronicle Whatsaap
The Bulawayo City Council has introduced water shedding. Entumbane suburb is the worst affected yet there are no boreholes at Entumbane. Maybe the money that has been collected for the pipeline should be used to repair the boreholes at Nyamandlovu. — S Mpala, Entumbane. I question the effectiveness of the church in Africa especially in Zimbabwe. Recently the so-called God fearing nation of Zimbabwe which prides itself of having churches on every corner became the epicentre of conflict and strife. Shops burnt, looted, roads barricaded by rogue elements. The irony and a paradox are preachers preaching dead cold sermons that man cannot be convicted. Has the church so much focused on riches, miracles and allowed the soul of man to rot in decay. — Rev Canaan Thomas, Bulawayo Twitter
Response to “Everyday is National Clean-up Day” Keeping the country clean is important. Not only does it keep the environment safe and free from diseases but it also promotes a feeling of patriotism. — @Tendai98.
