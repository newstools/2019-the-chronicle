The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter DYNAMOS captain Edward Sadomba will fully serve his two match suspension despite allegedly being ‘barred’ from playing in the Uhuru Cup final against Highlanders on Independence Day on the basis of the red card he received against Chicken Inn. According to media reports, the Harare giants were ordered not to field Sadomba in the final by a Zifa official because he was carrying a red card, which he was handed by Hwange-based referee Hardly Ndazi in their 2-0 loss to the Game Cocks at Barbourfields Stadium two weeks ago. The move to ‘bar’ Sadomba from the Uhuru final was interpreted by some observers as a bid to fast track his return to the Glamour Boys’ league matches as he would now have had to sit out today’s clash against Herentals, but be available for selection when Dynamos travel to Gweru to face league debutants TelOne. However, PSL communications and media liaison officer Kudzai Bare said the Independence Cup was under Zifa “and the red card applies to the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches only”. According to PSL rules and regulations order 33.2; any player expelled from the match via a red card shall immediately leave the pitch, or the bench, and in addition shall be for two official consecutive matches be suspended automatically. “For the avoidance of doubt, any friendly or charity match shall not be treated as an official match, and shall not operate to nullify the operation of the said red card.” Dynamos will now feel hard done by the order not to field their leader against their domestic rivals on Thursday in a game which they went on to be totally outclassed with Bosso lifting their eighth Independence Cup after a 2-0 win at the National Sports Stadium. With a single win in three competitive matches, underfire coach Lloyd Chigowe will be hard pressed to dig deeper into his seemingly leaking bag of tricks this afternoon to try and bring smiles to the Dynamos fans when they face tricky Herentals at Rufaro Stadium. A loss this afternoon might see the gaffer becoming the second coach this season to be relieved of his duties following Joseph Sibindi’s unceremonious exit from Bulawayo Chiefs after a 0-5 drubbing by Chapungu in their season opener.
