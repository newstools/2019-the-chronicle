The Chronicle Fungai Muderere, Senior Sports Reporter Cowdray Park based, Fireworks, welcome Khami in a potential mouth watering Bulawayo Social Soccer League encounter at Luveve High School tomorrow. Last weekend Fireworks were in rich vein of form that saw them wallop hapless neighbours, 94 Strivers, 4-0 in match that was played at TM ground in Cowdray Park. Going into Sunday’s game, Fireworks, will be banking on the services of in form trio of lanky former Gunners, AmaZulu and Bantu Rovers midfielder-cum-striker, Lucky “Crespo” Bungu, his elder brother Passmore and Calton Chirovama among other talented players. Lucky and Chirovama were both on target when Fireworks burnt the blunt Strikers in their previous encounter. Reigning champions, Stars FC, will take on fellow league seasoned campaigners Old Timers while Tshabalala based 70 Combination, who provide home to Highlanders assistant coach, Mandla “Lulu” Mpofu, entertain Douglas “British” Mloyi’s Mthala at Mambo ground. Social soccer followers will also witness a potentially explosive encounter between Ndola and Glenkara in Nkulumane while those who stay in Bulawayo’s high density suburb of Lobengula will witness a battle between Cream Tata and Legends.
