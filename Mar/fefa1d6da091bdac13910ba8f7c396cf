The Chronicle Sports Reporter FOUR bodybuilders from the Bulawayo Metropolitan Body Building and Fitness Association (BMBBFA) left the city yesterday morning for Harare, confident of bringing medals from the Mr and Ms Novice contest. The competition,  the first event in the National Federation of Zimbabwe Body-building and Fitness (NFZBBF) 2017 calendar, will see aspiring bodybuilders from across the country vying for the honours in five categories which are wheelchair men, senior men bodybuilding, junior men bodybuilding, women bikini fitness and men’s physique. Team Bulawayo is made up of Dynamics Gym’s TiNashe Mushamiri who is competing in the senior men’s category, men’s physique category’s pair of Dale Blair who trains at ProActive and Bodyworks’ Prechyhard Hoko, as well as Ricky Shahzad. Bulawayo’s provincial coach Simon Gama, said the province is aiming at winning the title in the men’s category. Bulawayo’s Kelly McDonald won the women’s title last year. “Our bodybuilders are raring to go and this time around gyms sent people that they thought are ready for the competition. This was because we failed to hold our traditional Mr Western Areas, a competition we use to choose participants. “We have confidence in the team and we hope this time we will be able to win in the men’s category which has always eluded the province. The team has been working hard and the only thing left is for them to go out there and do their best,” said Gama.
