The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter THE second edition of the Golf Course Turf and Equipment Management Symposium will be held at Harry Allen Golf Club from October 22-23. The two-day greenkeepers symposium hosted by the Zimbabwe Golf Course Superintendents Association (ZGCSA) will feature special guest presentations from South Africa and Kenya to cover turf and equipment management. “Preparations have been going well. We are going to issue out flyers for the symposium next week. Anybody interested in the turf management industry, even those in the soccer and cricket fields, is welcome,” said organising director Tizai Sithole. Representatives from American manufacturer of turf maintenance equipment Toro Company are expected to attend the symposium as special guests. They will present on irrigation equipment and mowing machines. South African company Talking Turf will do a presentation on how to maintain the turf. The company is a leading distributor of the turf and landscape market in Southern Africa and provides innovative agronomic solutions to unrivalled turf quality. “Greenkeepers is a profession which is not being recognised here. You go to South Africa and see those golf fields, those people are well trained and know how to look after their golf courses. The same can happen here,” Sithole said.
