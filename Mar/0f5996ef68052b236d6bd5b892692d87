The Chronicle Response to “Nac splurges a fortune on cars”. We don’t want corruption like this in the health sector. These people must be arrested and the law must take its course to discipline such culprits. Anti-corruption guys take these people to jail. – Milly. Response to “UAE delegation comes with love”. This shows the strong bond of solidarity that exists between the two countries. The UAE has great concern for Zimbabwe and the current problems it is facing in development. This is one of the countries that will help Zimbabwe grow. High level visits to our country all show this. — Rossah Chikowore. Besides the cyclone support they are also looking at giving us further support in our institutions which is very good. It’s not a once off support – it’s a continuous relationship that they would like to build with us and we are very happy with that. We appreciate their support and would want joint ventures in the pharmaceutical sector that can ensure a continuous supply of medicines in Zimbabwe. All this has been made possible by the new administration’s re-engagement plan to enhance our foreign policy, build mutual understanding and relations with other countries. The President is our number one ambassador in promoting closer linkages between diplomacy and the economy. Our foreign policy offensive by His Excellency is very much welcome. — Gakangoma.
