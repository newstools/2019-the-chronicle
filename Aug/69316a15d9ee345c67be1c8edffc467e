The Chronicle Ellen Chasokela, Harare Bureau THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) recapitalisation deal with the Diaspora Infrastructure Development Group (DIDG)/Transnet Consortium is now at advanced stages. DIDG/Transnet Consortium is the investor who won the tender for the US$400 million NRZ recapitalisation project. In an interview at the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show yesterday, (NRZ) public relations manager, Mr Nyasha Maravanyika, said they wanted to recapitalise to improve their services. “In 2017 Government approved for us to get an investor so we now have DIDG/Transnet,” he said. “We have been in negotiations that should end this month. “So, we wait to see what the team has come up with. Their resolutions are supposed to be taken to Cabinet and once Cabinet has approved, we will have a greenlight to seal the deal.” Mr Maravanyika said they only have five passenger trains that are functional. NRZ requires $1,9 billion in the long term to fully rehabilitate and recapitalise operations.
