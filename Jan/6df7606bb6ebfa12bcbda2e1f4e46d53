THE future of Highlanders’ developmental side Bosso 90 was thrown into uncertainty following calls to the leadership to consider disbanding the project or register it in the Zifa Bulawayo province to reduce costs. Bosso 90 plays in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League that stretches as far as Victoria Falls. Contributing to debate at the club’s annual general meeting held at the club house yesterday, Highlanders’ member Andrew Tapela said with increasing costs in running the Division One entity, there was a need for the leadership to critically review costs that come with maintaining the project in view of the escalating costs. “We really need to have a sober analysis of our Bosso 90 project, to evaluate its benefits to the club vis-a vis the costs of keeping it afloat compared to our financial ability. If we want to maintain it, I would humbly suggest that we register it as an Under-20 side in the Bulawayo League where the furthest they have to travel will maybe be Gwabalanda and that way the club will also save a lot,” said Tapela, who is also the Zifa Southern Region chairman. In his response, club chairman Kenneth Mhlophe welcomed the suggestion and said it was critical that members come up with ideas on how to run the Bosso 90 project. “This is your project fellow members; don’t wait for meetings such as these to suggest how best you feel we ought to run it, so thank you very much to ubaba uTapela for that view point. We will have to look at it critically,” said Mhlophe. The idea behind the Bosso 90 project was to be a feeder to the first team but Tapela said a talented player could still be promoted from the Under-18 side straight into the first team in the same manner that the club’s greats such as incumbent head coach Madinda Ndlovu broke into the team.
