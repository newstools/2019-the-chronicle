GWERU City Council (GCC) yesterday paid its employees their 2018 bonuses amid revelations that the local authority is now up to date in terms of payment of salaries. In an interview, Mayor Councillor Josiah Makombe said council’s more than 1 100 employees had all received their 2018 bonuses. The payment of the bonuses is coming at a time when council workers are requesting a hardship allowance equivalent to 30 percent of their salaries. “Yes we have paid all our employees their 2018 bonuses. We are also now up to date with payment of salaries and as such we no longer owe workers in terms of salaries,” he said. A member of the GCC workers’ committee Mr Polite Sibangani said they were happy with the payment of bonuses. He said the 13th cheque will go a long way in cushioning them against the rising cost of living. “We are very happy that we have received our bonuses and also that council has cleared outstanding salaries,” he said. The local authority last year gave employees residential stands as part of payment of their outstanding salaries. The stands are mostly in the newly established Mkoba 21 suburb. The council also agreed to pay the workers’ medical and funeral expenses as well as school fees and then deduct the money from the outstanding salaries.
