GWERU-based gospel musician, Moscow Pembere’s star is slowly rising after his song was voted the best song of the year at the 2018 Midlands Arts Awards held recently. The winning song Favour Seunorota which features renowned musician Pastor Olinda Marowa, has been receiving airplay on a number of radio stations. Pembere, who is a devout Christian, said he grew up singing in the Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) Church choir and was also a member of the school choir at Chegutu Primary. “I’m a Christian and my passion is to preach the Word of God through music,” said Pembere. He said he sees himself performing on an international stage in five years time. Pembere said he is inspired by Pastor Charamba, Pastor Olinda, Libert Ticharwa and Mathias Mhere. “I’m working on a single called Mweya Mutsvene featuring Pastor Olinda and Mathias Mhere,” he said. Pembere’s music is produced by DJ Kuhlekani and marketed by Heavy-Weights Fans Group.
