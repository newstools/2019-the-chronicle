The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent PREPARATIONS for the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Midlands finale are underway with 19 contestants set to compete for the crown next Saturday. The pageant will be held at King Solomon’s Hotel in Kwekwe with the top three contestants expected to represent the Midlands province at the national finale set for September in Harare. Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Midlands co-ordinator Mavis Koslek said the finalists are now perfecting their catwalk ahead of the provincial finale which will be held out of Gweru for the first time. “The girls are meeting during weekends for rehearsals as most of them (MSU students) will be attending lectures during the week,” Koslek said. Due to financial constraints, Koslek said there would be no boot camp for the finalists. “We’d hoped to have a boot camp where all the models would meet and stay together a few days before the pageant, but due to financial constraints, this will likely not happen. As such, we’re appealing to the business community and individuals to assist towards the hosting of this pageant.” Koslek thanked King Solomon’s proprietor, Solomon Matsa, for coming through for them. “We’re really grateful to Mr Solomon Matsa (owner of King Solomon’s Hotel) who has chipped in so far and provided accommodation and a venue for the event, free of charge,” she said. Koslek said the finalists were picked from Zvishavane, Kwekwe, Gweru, Gokwe and Shurugwi and were initially 24, but five were dropped for various reasons, chief among them, indiscipline.
