The Chronicle Auxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter THE Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has said the country is expected to experience heavy rains that may result in flash floods and damage to property. The rains which began on Tuesday are expected to last up to tomorrow. The MSD said the rains will be accompanied by heavy winds that may uproot trees. “Heavy rains are expected countrywide with heavier falls in excess of 50mm in 24 hours likely in parts of Manicaland, Mashonaland East and Central, Harare Metropolitan, Masvingo provinces as well as southern areas of the Midlands Province” from Tuesday till today. Of note around Thursday the 17th some of these areas are forecast to receive heavier rain in excess of 70 mm in 24 hours, reads the MSD statement. It said the rains are expected to subsidise from Friday. “Indications are that these rains may result in sharp downpours, damaging winds, hail and flash flooding. Uprooting of trees and damage to infrastructure cannot be ruled out with this type of rainfall. It said in case of thunderstorms, if one is outdoors they must seek shelter immediately but not under trees or isolated sheds. “Exercise caution on the roads especially at night when it is difficult to identify flood dangers. Avoid crossing flooded rivers and swollen streams where the depth is unknown,” it warned. Zimbabwe is expected to receive normal to below normal rainfall this season. – @AuxiliaK
