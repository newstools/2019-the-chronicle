The Chronicle Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter A POLICE officer stationed at Sipepa, Tsholotsho has appeared in court for allegedly indecently assaulting his nine-year-old daughter and threatening to kill her. The accused person (33) was remanded out of custody to May 22 for continuation of trial after pleading not guilty before Bulawayo Regional magistrate Mrs Sibongile Msipa  Marondedze. Prosecuting, Ms Concilia Ncube said the complainant is a Grade Three pupil and is the biological child of the accused person. Allegations are that on November 20 last year during the day, the complainant visited her father with her younger sister at Tshabalala Flats, Bulawayo. “As they were watching television, the accused person joined the girls and sat on the same sofa with the complainant and started kissing the complainant on the mouth and cheeks. “He allegedly inserted his hand into complainant’s undergarments and started caressing her privates,” said Ms Ncube. The complainant asked her father to stop but the accused person persisted. The complainant’s sister, who heard her telling the accused person to stop, also asked him to stop whatever he was doing. “At around 9PM same day, they retired to bed and accused person asked to join them but the younger sister refused saying there wasn’t enough space. “The following morning the accused person allegedly started kissing the complainant and inserted his finger into the complainant’s privates,” Ms Ncube said. She said accused person gave the younger child 50 cents and told her to go and play outside. “The accused person threatened to kill the complainant if she ever disclosed the ordeal to anyone. “The two minors returned to their    mother’s house.
