AT least 110 swimmers are expected to compete in the Matabeleland Amateur Swimming Board (MASB) Junior Championships to be held at Petra Primary School in Bulawayo on Sunday. The championships will also be used to select swimmers to represent the province at the National Junior Championships to be held at Petra Primary on the weekend of March 16-17. Bokani Dube, the MASB chairperson, said they expect stiff competition at the weekend meet, with swimmers that participated in the Zimbabwe National Swimming Championships expected to set the stage alight. “The Matabeleland Amateur Swimming Board Junior Championships is open to swimmers that participate in the 12 years and under age groups. “We expect all the seven clubs to send their swimmers. According to our register, we are looking at having about 110 swimmers battling it out for places in the team that will compete at the national competition in March. “Participating in this gala also gives our swimmers an opportunity to post qualifying times to enable them to compete in regional competitions,” said Dube. Clubs affiliated to MASB are Barracudas, BG Dolphins, Crusaders, Penguins, SOS, Stingrays and Zambezi Tigers. Some of the swimmers that took part in the Zimbabwe National Swimming Championships held at the beginning of the month in Harare are the Under-12 girls’ category trio of Onye Onovo, Avril Carinus and Pamela Ncube. Onesimus Ngwenya, Kayden Bhana, Tawanda Jani, Ruan Nel, Khaya Vimba, Reece Rollo, Nsikelelo Sibanda and Sibusiso Sibanda also represented MASB in the boys’ Under-12 category in Harare. — @ZililoR
