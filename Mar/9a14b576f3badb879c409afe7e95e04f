The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo A LOCAL automotive company, Amtec, has opened another branch in Masvingo in fulfilment of its objective to increase business footprint in the country. The company has been operating in Zimbabwe for 70 years and has other branches in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru and Mutare. Responding to emailed questions, Amtec regional manager for Masvingo and Midlands, Mr Prince Chibinya, said the company was keen to set up more business in major cities. “We started operating in Masvingo on January 7 this year. Our opening of Masvingo branch is indeed an expansion drive and fulfillment of our desire of being accessible. We also want to be visible to motorists as we endeavour to provide total motoring solutions to our motorists,” said Mr Chibinya. He said before establishing the Masvingo branch, which has created 10 jobs, customers would travel long distances to access their services. “We are not only breaking even but we are profitable. We run our business on solid infrastructure that was developed over almost 70 years that Amtec has been in the automotive business,” said Mr Chibinya. Within its stable, Amtec has a franchise range of Nissan, Mazda, BAIC and the TAFE Tractors. —@walterbmswazie2
