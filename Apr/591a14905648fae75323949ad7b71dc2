The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FOLLOWING a nightmare start to the 2019 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season in which they picked up pieces in a 5-0 hammering by Chapungu on Saturday, Bulawayo Chiefs have rehired coach Thulani Sibanda. Sibanda quit the club three weeks before the start of the season after Joseph Sibindi had been appointed head coach, saying he was pursuing other projects. Sibanda doesn’t possess the mandatory Caf A coaching badge to sit in the PSL dugout. Chiefs’ director Lovemore Sibanda told Chronicle Sport yesterday that Thulani joins the technical department as fitness coach. “With immediate effect, Thulani Sibanda is back as our fitness coach. After watching the Chapungu game, we noticed that we came short in terms of fitness and that is why we’ve decided to bring Thulani. He is familiar with the system,” said the Chiefs director. On the structure of the technical team, the Chiefs boss said that will be clarified today. Other members of Chiefs’ technical team are assistant coach Mduduzi Mpofu, a teacher at Milton Junior School, goalkeepers’ trainer Nkosiyazi Ncube and former Highlanders defender Anzilom Ndlovu, who has also been doubling up as juniors’ coach. — @ZililoR
