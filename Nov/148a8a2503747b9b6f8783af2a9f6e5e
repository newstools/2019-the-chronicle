The Chronicle Football legend Didier Drogba helped launch a drive on Friday to plant a million trees to halt deforestation in cote d’Ivoire. The “One Day, One Million Trees” campaign “is a first step, the start of the recovery”, Forestry and Water Resources Minister Alain Richard Donwahi said in Abidjan, the country’s main city. “Our goal is to recover at least 30% (of lost forest cover) by 2030,” he said. Most of Cote d’Ivoire’s 20 000km2 of forests are considered badly degraded. Drogba said the “numbers are alarming”, referring to projections that the tropical West African nation would lose all its forest cover in half a century if corrective steps were not taken. “I am proud to contribute to Cote d’Ivoire’s reforestation through helping awareness,” the former Chelsea star said, describing the tree planting as a “noble initiative.” Cote d’Ivoire, the world’s biggest cocoa producer and a major coffee exporter, plans to reforest eight million hectares by 2045. — Al Jazeera
