The Chronicle Response to “CAPS WIN again, DeMbare WIN at last, Bosso fail to Win once again”. Yes, Caps, Bosso and of course the almighty DeMbare are all that matters when it comes to football in this country, but hey something needs to give in at Highlanders. – Eliah. Response to “Industry demands ‘truly’ floating rate”. Industry is holding the Government to ransom. They demanded trade liberalisation and they got it, then they started using it to profiteer. They called for interbank forex market, they got it. They get forex from interbank at 1:3,30 and sell it on the black market at 1:4:50-75. It’s high time the Government cracks the whip. There is so much profiteering around, hence, the need for a commission of enquiry to investigate how these businesses are making such huge profits in a burdened economy. – Isaiah Kamanga. Response to “Tsvangirai family hails ED”. Bravo to the Government! That shows it is a Government for all Zimbabweans, though the MDC has no consideration for citizens except for their self-aggrandisement, and self-enrichment at the expense of the masses. This deflates the West’s bubbles. They want to see brother fighting against brother to our own detriment so they can swoop in and recolonise us. — Gerrie. Well done Comrade ED, you are, indeed, a man of the people. Makanyanya Shumba, vanovukura, vachingovukura. — Mumu.
