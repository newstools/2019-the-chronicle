Seagirl sustained injuries on her right ankle and left leg after bricks fell on her. <img class=" wp-image-447436" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Jah-Prayzah-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-3-360x240.jpg" alt="" width="737" height="491" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Jah-Prayzah-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-3-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Jah-Prayzah-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Jah-Prayzah-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-3-680x453.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px" /> Jah Prayzah  One male fan was nearly buried by the bricks and his leg appeared broken. He lay on the ground unconscious for some time as people removed the blocks burying him. Fans took advantage of the mishap to gain free entry into the venue and those attending to the injured had to create a barricade to protect the victims from the stampeding crowd. The seriously injured fan was later rushed to hospital by ambulance. Seagirl who was not taken to hospital however appeared to be in excruciating pain. <img class=" wp-image-447440" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/ExQ-on-stage-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-1-360x240.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="486" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/ExQ-on-stage-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/ExQ-on-stage-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/ExQ-on-stage-pic-cred-Peter-Mutukwa-1-680x453.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /> ExQ on stage Th VIP entrance was not the only place where there was chaos. At the main gate where ordinary ticket holders were, bouncers had a torrid time controlling the people. The show organisers should have opened more gates as those manning the single gate were overwhelmed by the huge crowds.
