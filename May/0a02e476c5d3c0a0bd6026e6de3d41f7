The Chronicle Pamela Shumba, Chronicle Reporter POLICE are looking for 4 500 criminals who are on the run for committing various offences. Eighteen of the fugitives from justice were arrested during an operation conducted by the police Women Network last week. In a statement yesterday, police national spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the operation targeted wanted persons for cases of violence against women and children. “The ZRP (Zimbabwe Republic Police) recently conducted a simultaneous Southern Region Police Chiefs Cooperation Operation (SARPCCO), code named BASADI from 8 to 10 May 2019. “By the second day of the operation, 18 wanted persons had been arrested out of 4 583 wanted persons on record across the country’s provinces,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said the police will continue to hunt for the wanted persons in all the country’s provinces. “The decision for this operation came as a result of decision 22 by SARPCCO police chiefs at the 19th Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on May 23, 2014 in Namibia, which mandated National Police Women Network structures to annually conduct this simultaneous regional operation. “However, the ZRP continues to hunt for these people wanted for various crimes even after the operation is concluded,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He added that apart from arresting wanted persons, the ZRP had also been involved in conducting crime awareness campaigns to educate the public on crimes of passion. “A total of 237 crime awareness campaigns reaching 16 670 people were conducted across the country by day two of the operation,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. The country has in the past months recorded an upsurge in crime, with the police calling for the involvement of members of the public and corporate world in the prevention and management of crime. —@pamelashumba1
