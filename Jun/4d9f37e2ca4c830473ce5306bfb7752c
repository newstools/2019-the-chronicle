The Chronicle Editor – “The President listens, speaks to the people on radio and warns overcharging businesses”, The Chronicle June 15, 2019. Referring to the above, the Hon President Emmerson Mnangagwa said, “Such dealers should be punished at some point in the life of their businesses”. May I propose that effective from January 2019, when the very businesses started raising prices unjustified, willy nilly, to sabotage the Government of Zimbabwe, the Government through Zimra should visit all businesses concerned as a matter of urgency and demand to audit all monies raised since January to date and introduce a special heavy taxation to all concerned as punishment. All supermarkets eg OK, TM, etc be punished. Whoever defies the order should have their trading licences withdrawn. Enough is enough Hon President. “Time shall come when we make the life of their businesses difficult,” once said the Hon President. – Thomson Dube, Hwange
