Studio 263 actor Jabu (real name Denzel Burutsa) successfully stole the limelight from Winky D at the weekend after his sex-tape emerged and started doing the rounds on social media. People had been emulating Winky D and another artiste Gemma for their quality MuGarden music video. But in no time, long forgotten Jabu had taken all the limelight with people discussing his unpleasant video clip that has left many worried. In the two-minute clip, Jabu is captured with no condom, in the presence of a child, making love to a woman who seems older than him. What has irked many is Jabu’s decision to have unprotected sex with the woman. Clearly concerned about Jabu’s health, most urged him to seek medical attention. Some described the actor as a fearless person as he chose not to use protection. “Ndomasoja chaiwo ka aya anoenda kuhondo achiziva kuti kunofiwa (these are real soldiers who go to war knowing there’s a possibility of death),” one Douglas Jekero said in apparent reference to the risk of Jabu contracting diseases. “Zimwe ihlawoo! Join funeral policy and plan your will,” suggested another who felt that Jabu was doomed. The presence of the child in the room during this act has also been condemned by some. While the woman’s age is just a number, there were those who described her looks as disgusting and distasteful. Others felt that Jabu needed help as he could have been taking drugs that led him to do this act. “If you’re on drugs, please stop them. They’re messing you. That video is a sign that something is wrong with you brother. Get help,” commented one Nyasha Nya. Jabu’s act certainly served as a wake up call to many to stop recording X-rated clips.
