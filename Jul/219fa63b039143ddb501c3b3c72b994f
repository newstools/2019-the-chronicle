The Chronicle Peter Ngwenya, Bulawayo Editor: Minister Fortune Chasi, I know you are a new broom. There are underlying causes as to why Zesa finds its self in this quagmire. The causes are in-house corruption. There was no corresponding, responsive staff rationalisation to offset the introduction of the Cash Power utility. There is probably a duplication of duties and staff underemployment because of the desire to keep relatives employed. Do not overlook the cancer of bribes to get re-connected. This is a crime that occurs in the field between residents and known Zesa employees. Yes, they are known. Just increase the number of suggestions and whistle-blowers’ boxes close to the people. It won’t be prudent to craft new Regulations and Laws to have them implemented by people who have brought Zesa to its knees. That would be ridiculous. New Laws — clean record people, we can attain profitable levels.
