The Chronicle MAURICIO POCHETTINO has avoided a touchline ban for Tottenham’s Champions League final against Liverpool. The Spurs manager has been given a one-match ban linked to the delayed start of the semi-final first leg with Ajax, but his suspension has been deferred for a probation period of one year. Spurs have also been fined 10,000 euros (£8,758) for the incident. The club have also been fined 5,000 euros for a pitch invasion in their quarter-final with Manchester City. Managers of both clubs are held responsible if a Champions League game does not start on time, regardless of the circumstances, and it is the second time it has happened to Tottenham this season. The first indiscretion earns a warning, as Ajax boss Erik ten Hag has received, and a repeat offence earns a one-match touchline ban, which is always suspended. Tottenham qualified for their first Champions League final after a stunning second-leg comeback against Ajax in Amsterdam. Lucas Moura scored a second-half hat-trick as Spurs overturned a three-goal deficit to progress on away goals and set up a meeting with Liverpool in Madrid on 1 June. Meanwhile, among fines for other clubs, Porto have been fined 42,000 euros for blocking stairways, setting off fireworks and the late kick-off in their Champions League quarter-final second leg with Liverpool. Porto head coach, Sergio Conceicao, is also banned for one Uefa competition match for being responsible for a late kick-off. — SuperSport
