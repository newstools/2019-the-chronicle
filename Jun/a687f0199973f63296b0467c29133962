The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders’ development coach Gift Lunga Jr registered his first win as Mosi Rovers head coach, beating Moto Moto 1-0 in a Southern Region Division One League match played on Saturday. Lunga joined the Victoria Falls-based club last month replacing Zibonele Ncube and had gone for four games without a win after drawing his first match, before losing three consecutive outings. Lesley Mulenga scored the solitary goal that eased pressure on Lunga. The victory moved Mosi Rovers from the basement, going a place up the log to position 14 with five points. Lunga admitted that he was feeling the pressure and hopes to build on the victory. “We have been playing well, but luck wasn’t on our side. We’ve been creating scoring opportunities which we’ve been failing to convert in games that we played. I think this win will lift our confidence. The good thing is that the boys have now adapted to the style of play I introduced. I still feel the need to bring in a central defender, a defensive midfielder and two strikers that will add value to the team as we seek to fight for a top eight finish,” said Lunga. While Lunga celebrated his first victory, Bulawayo City cemented their position at the top of the table, taking their unbeaten run to 10 games after beating Toronto 1-0. City are now on 24 points and enjoy a three-point lead over second-placed Talen Vision. Vision thrashed Plumtree-based Mainline 3-0 to keep their title hopes alive.
