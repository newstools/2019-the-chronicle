ZIMBABWE Volleyball Association has been rocked by serious discontent resulting in the postponement of its annual general meeting which had been slated for February 16. According to sources, bullying, alleged inappropriate relationships between executive committee members and players as well as staff members is rampant in the association, forcing some concerned staff members to hand in their resignations. “That is news to me, I haven’t received or seen any letters of resignation from our staff or executive committee members,” said ZVA secretary-general Tawanda Sithole, demanding names of staff members that have tendered their resignation letters. Chronicle Sport can reveal that the ZVA head of corporate affairs Nothando Magwaza has since resigned from the association and she told close friends that she would only be in a position to give her reasons after her exit interview. “Magwaza has apparently had enough and I know for a fact that she tendered her resignation letter. Things are not well at ZVA and Magwaza could no longer stomach the rot,” said a source. Efforts to get a comment from Magwaza were unsuccessful, but posts on her Facebook timeline seemed to confirm her resignation. “It’s never easy to say goodbye to something you love dearest; something that had become part of your life; something that made you laugh and cry at the same time; something that made you feel alive,” wrote Magwaza. Magwaza was a volleyball player before injury cut her promising career short and had been ZVA head of corporate affairs since May 2018.
