CONTRARY to earlier reports that the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association failed to hold its annual general meeting, the association president Ringisayi Mapondera has confirmed that the meeting did take place in Matabeleland North. Eight of the provincial chairpersons graced the meeting in which an audited accounts statement was presented as well as the upcoming 2019 calendar of events. “The AGM took place, audited accounts were presented, budget was presented and approved, president’s report on activities in the past year was presented and a calendar of events was approved for 2019. All items of the agenda as provided for by our constitution were attended to,” wrote the ZVA president in an emailed response to this publication. Mapondera, who took over from one of the best volleyball brains to emerge from the country, Fredrick Ndlovu, also confirmed the resignation of their head of corporate affairs, Nothando Magwaza. “Indeed she was head corporate affairs, an ad hoc committee of five members created to boost the image of ZVA as well as attend to the image of ZVA. “She is within her rights to resign from the position just as any member of the association is entitled to resign for whatever reason. She intimated her wish to resign and that has since been accepted. “We have appreciated and have thanked her for her contribution to this great association and have wished her luck in her future endeavours,” wrote Mapondera. Meanwhile, according to the ZVA’s calendar of events, a sports administration course Level One will be held in Harare from March 22-24 while a week later the Zimbabwe Open Tournament will be conducted at a venue to be advised in due course. Bulawayo will play host to national volleyball league playoffs from April 10 -12.
