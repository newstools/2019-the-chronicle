The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO’S five National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) districts will converge this weekend at St Columbas High School to select a provincial chess team that will compete in the inter-provincials in Masvingo next month. A total of 140 learners from the five districts, Mzilikazi, Reigate, Khami, Imbizo and Bulawayo Central, will compete in seven boys and girls’ age groups; Under-13s, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 20. “The Bulawayo province’s Nash Chess Championships are on at St Columbas High School this weekend and will be played over two days ending on Sunday, March 17. The purpose of these games is to choose our provincial team that will compete at the National Scholar Championship from April 11 to 14 at Victoria High School, Masvingo. What will happen is that we will select four players per age group, two boys and two girls,” said Mthokozisi Ngwenya, St Columbas’ sports director. Ngwenya is confident that from the pool that will compete at the weekend they can select a squad that will earn the province medals in Masvingo. “Last year when Bulawayo hosted the National Scholars Championship, we performed badly, coming out eighth out of 10 provinces. The standard of chess in the Bulawayo schools’ league has been improving as most schools are sending their learners to participate at Bulawayo Chess Association’s organised monthly tournaments. We are confident that the team we select will do better than last year,” Ngwenya said. – @ZililoR.
