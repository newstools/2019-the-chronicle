The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent There was commotion at the Kwekwe Magistrates’ Courts on Thursday after a man collapsed in the dock soon after conviction. When magistrate Mr Storey Rushambwa started reading out judgment, Portipha Musiiwa (49) who together with his son, Talent (24) were convicted of assaulting a client, collapsed sending the gallery into panic. Court proceedings had to be briefly adjourned as the prison officers and other Good Samaritans whisked Musiiwa from the dock before rendering first aid. The court proceedings resumed after almost an hour after Musiiwa recovered. Musiiwa and Talent were sentenced to three months in prison which was wholly suspended on condition they do not commit a similar offence in the next five years. The State case against the two was that on June 13, 2018, around 4pm, Musiiwa of 2962 Faraday Street, Newtown, Kwekwe, had a misunderstanding with Tapiwa Ndiwoneyi whom they had given their vehicle for panel beating. The misunderstanding degenerated into a fight resulting in Musiiwa and son beating up Mr Ndiwoneyi, accusing him of taking too long to repair their damaged vehicle. Musiiwa later produced an iron bar which he used to strike the complainant once on the back of the head and on the shoulder. Musiiwa who was being assisted by his son also used the bar to strike Mr Ndiwoneyi on the right hand. Talent kicked the complainant on the nose causing bleeding. Mr Ndiwoneyi was later taken to Kwekwe Provincial Hospital where he was treated and discharged.
