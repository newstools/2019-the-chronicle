The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter AWARD-winning actress and singer Qeqeshiwe Mntambo will be hosting a concert at Shisha Marrakesh (14th Ave and Fife St) in Bulawayo on Thursday. Qeqe said all was in place for the concert dubbed “The Love Affair”. “It’s been three years since I last did a musical concert so this is definitely a good comeback show for me. The concert is aimed at bringing people together to spread love and positivity. “The title of the concert might mislead some into thinking that it’s about romantic love, but that’s not the love I’m referring to,” Qeqe said. The Jazz songstress said her focus this year is on staging more live shows. <img class="size-medium wp-image-443180" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Qeqeshiwe-Mntambo-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Qeqeshiwe-Mntambo-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Qeqeshiwe-Mntambo-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Qeqeshiwe-Mntambo-680x529.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Qeqeshiwe-Mntambo.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Qeqeshiwe Mntambo performing on stage “Live shows are very intimate and fans can easily connect with you and your music hence why I want to stage a lot of them this year. People should come and experience the love and great music – which will be a mixture of jazz and other genres at the concert,” she said. Fans, Qeqe said, should look out for her new music that she will be releasing some time this year. “I have a song with a Cape Town musician called Da Luke and I’ll be releasing it this year. I’ve also done something with DJ Mdu Sevan and people should look out for more music from Qeqeshiwe in 2019.” At the concert, she will be backed by the Jam Sessions band.
