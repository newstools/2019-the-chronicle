Jah Signal is no doubt one of the most sought after Zimdancehall artistes at the moment. He will be touring the United Kingdom this month before going to America next month, Canada in June, Australia in August while a China tour is being finalised. The musician said he has more new material that he will be putting out and at the end of this month he will release a singles collection. “The singles collection helps me in experimenting with various sounds and to see what people like or dislike before I put out an album.” Jah Signal said despite his tight schedule this year, he was hoping to release 12 music videos and also collaborate with some big names for the album.
