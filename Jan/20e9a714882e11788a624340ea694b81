ALGERIAN match officials will handle the crucial Total Caf Champions League Group B match between FC Platinum and Horoya of Guinea set for this Saturday at Barbourfields Stadium. Mustapha Ghorbal (33) will be the whistle man assisted by Abdelhah Etchiali and Mokrame Gourari, with Boukhalfa Nabil as the fourth official. Patrick Kangwa from Zambia is the match commissioner and South African Jerome Damon is the referees’ assessor. The general co-ordinator of the match will be Sidio Jose Mugadza from Mozambique, while Ugandan Dixon Okello will be in charge of security. FC Platinum have to win this tie if they entertain any hopes of making a quarter-final appearance. Pure Platinum Play are yet to find the target in 180 minutes of football after playing to a goalless draw against 1995 winners Orlando Pirates in their opening game before falling 0-2 to defending champions Esperance at the Stade Marien in Tunisia. Coach Norman Mapeza, while publicly noting that they are not under pressure, acknowledged that they need to capitalise on home advantage and get maximum points. FC Platinum are third on the table behind Orlando Pirates and Esperance, who both sit on four points, while the Zvishavane-based side and Horoya have a point each. Horoya arrived in the country at the weekend and have been going through their paces in Harare. Meanwhile, gate charges for the encounter have been maintained at $5 for the rest of ground, $10 for the wings and $20 for the VIP. In the last encounter against Orlando Pirates, 23 164 fans paid to watch the duel. The club has since opened up accreditation for members of the media with the accreditation forms available on the club’s website www.fc-platinum.net.
