Mr Mudenda refused and Nhlanhla allegedly stabbed him on his left hand. Fearing for his life, Mr Mudenda surrendered his bag. “Simelinkosi joined in the scuffle grabbing the complainant’s satchel and sleeping bag,” said the prosecutor. Nhlanhla and his other accomplice allegedly searched Mr Mudenda’s satchel and left with his belongings. Mr Mudenda reported the matter at Bulawayo Central Police Station leading to the arrest of Nhlanhla and Simelinkosi. – @zinyuke98
