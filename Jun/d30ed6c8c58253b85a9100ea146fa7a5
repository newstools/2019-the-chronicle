The Chronicle Response to “US-Africa summit boost for Zimbabwe”. This is a great opportunity for the country and President Mnangagwa should represent us and strike deals that will boost the country’s economy. – RayScott970 Response to “Criminal gangs take over VID licensing”. The police should deal with these criminal elements. These are the same people responsible for road accidents as they award incompetent people licences. A lengthy sentence should be given to those caught offside to send a clear message that the Government does not tolerate corrupt activities. — Ceaphasi Mutubu1 Response to “Govt calls for collective effort to end power crisis”. This is the right direction for Government to step up efforts to address electricity challenges bedevilling the country. There should be long-lasting solutions to this situation. The long hours of load-shedding being experienced by domestic and some commercial consumers of power are really disturbing. Government should call on all responsible authorities to work tirelessly to end the problem which is acting down upon our economy. — Chido Manhombo RESPONSE to “More vocational training centres needed”. If devolution is implemented well with all minds focusing on development, nationwide visible economic growth is within sights. Every Zimbabwean province is rich with both human and natural resources. For example, Mashonaland Central has many underutilised water bodies, gold claims, and good road networks. So, those selected to oversee devolutionary matters should consult widely with the people and map the way forward together. There is need for more vocational training centres in the provinces coupled by functional health institutions. School libraries should have enough books and equipped laboratories. Devolution for development. — Thomas Murisa.
