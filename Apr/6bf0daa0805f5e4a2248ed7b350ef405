The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter PLUMTREE-based Southern Region Division One League side Mainline FC were the weekend’s biggest scorers after hammering Pumula East outfit Toronto FC 5-1 in the border town. Goals from Victor Nkomo, Mbongeni Ndlovu, Luke Tembo, Trust Msindo and Denzel Dube powered Mainline to their first win of the season and they made a great leap from 10th to sixth place on the league table. Toronto dropped down the ladder into 10th place. Charlton Gumede, the Mainline manager, said they hope to build from the weekend victory in their endeavour to fight for the league championship. “When the club was established, the directors had an ambition to see the team in the Premiership by 2020. This is our second year in the First Division and I think we are on course to effectively compete. We’ve a seasoned coach in Paul Moyo and the players we have are fighting hard to help the team achieve its ambition. It won’t be an easy race, but what I know is that we’re in the league to compete and those who want to rule us out can do so at their own peril,” said Gumede. Mainline are now five points behind log leaders Talen Vision, the only team to have won their opening three games. Vision edged Bosso 90 1-0 in a tightly contested game. Mainline lost their opening game of the season 2-1 to Bosso 90, drew 0-0 away to Indlovu Iyanyathela before the victory over Toronto. ZPC Hwange registered their second consecutive 1-0 win by claiming the scalp of Casmyn to take their points tally to six and remain among the leading pack. ZPC Hwange are tied on six points with third-placed Bosso 90 and fourth-placed CIWU, who beat Mosi Rovers 2-1 in Victoria Falls. Former Premiership side Bulawayo City, who are second on the table with seven points, dropped two points on the road after being held to a 0-0 draw by newboys Binga Pirates. “It’s just a minor setback and I think a point on the road is better. I’m happy with the display, but not the result because we need more points in the early stages of the season to remain on track,” said Try Ncube, the Bulawayo City coach.
