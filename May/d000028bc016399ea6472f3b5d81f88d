The Chronicle Khahliso Ncube NIXON Johnson Shindi of the Apa Hauna Cash hit has been nominated for the South Africa Music Awards (Sama) in the Rest of Africa Artiste category. The afro-fusion artiste is nominated alongside the late Dr Oliver Mtukudzi, Mr Eazi, Diamond Platnumz and Kommanda Obbs. Signed under Universal Music South Africa record label, Shindi made it on the nominees list through his song Who We Are. Born and raised in Masvingo, the 28-year-old artiste made a name for himself in 2015 when he rode on the Apa Hauna Cash catchphrase that was popularised by flamboyant businessman Phillip Chiyangwa. The artiste, who is now based in South Africa, said being nominated for the Samas was a huge achievement. “I’ve been in South Africa for almost a year-and-a-half so being nominated for the Samas is a big achievement for an up-and-coming artiste like me. “I was pleasantly shocked when I received the invitation to the Sama awards as a nominee in one of their categories,” said Nixon. Universal Music SA said they were proud of the fast-rising artiste and had no regrets signing him. Nixon is part of the 38 Sama nominees from his record label. “As the Universal Music group, we’re proud of our artist Nixon. The nomination has proved to us as a record label that we’ve hit a jackpot in signing him up under our wing and this is making us grow as a brand,” said Yule Dark, Nixon’s manager.
