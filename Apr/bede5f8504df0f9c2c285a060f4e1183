The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter AN epic Independence Cup match is on cards at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon with Highlanders declaring that they will field a strong side as part of continuing efforts to get players match-fit. Bosso face rivals Dynamos in the $80 000 Zimbabwe @39 celebratory game. In the past, Highlanders have sent second- string sides to the tournament, but this time around coach Madinda Ndlovu said they are using the encounter to fine tune their squad, having been affected by a three-week strike during the pre-season. Strikers, Prince Dube and Zambian import Peter Nyirenda will miss today’s action because of injury, but hope to return for the Easter Monday league game against Triangle United at Barbourfields Stadium. Right-back McClive Phiri, who was sent off in the horrendous 3-1 loss to Harare City last weekend, is also out of the team, with Bukhosi Ncube replacing him. New signing, Bukhosi Sibanda, who joined from Ubuntu Cape Town of South Africa, is set to get his first Bosso cap and lead the strike force. Despite the Dube and Nyirenda setbacks, coach Ndlovu said they are ready for Dynamos, adding that there is nothing “friendly” about facing Dynamos. <img class="size-medium wp-image-445892" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-10-360x296.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="296" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-10-360x296.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-10-768x632.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-10-680x560.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Dynamos and Highlanders supporters “Our approach is simple; we’re playing Dynamos and everyone within the Highlanders family knows what it means to play against Dynamos. Just as a reminder, games against Dynamos are more than just a game because there’s pride at stake, bragging rights and both sets of supporters are keen to see their team win. So, we’re going there to fight for a positive result,” said Ndlovu. “Another factor to consider is that as Highlanders we’ve been crying that our players are not match fit and this is a game we will also use to improve match-fitness for our boys. So we are not fielding a second-string side, but a strong team minus those ruled out because of injuries and suspension in the league. It’s a practice game before we take on Triangle United next Monday,” he said. Dynamos and Highlanders head into today’s encounter smarting from defeats in their lastleague games on the road. DeMbare were humbled 2-0 by Chicken Inn in Bulawayo, while Bosso were humiliated 3-1 by Harare City. Ndlovu will also use today’s encounter to gauge his combinations and look for players that can play around Nqobizitha Masuku in midfield. Masuku has been outstanding in Highlanders’ three league games playing as a defensive midfielder. Players in line to fit in the midfield puzzle are Brian Banda, Adrian Silla, Ben Munsaka, Divine Mhindiriri, Denzel Khumalo, utility player Mbekezeli Sibanda and winger, Cleopas Kapupurika. Sibanda is likely to partner Tinashe Makanda upfront, with the quartet of Ncube, Peter Muduhwa, Tendai Ndlovu and Mbongeni Ndlovu forming the backline, while Ariel Sibanda gets the nod ahead of Wellington Muuya in keeping goal. — @ZililoR.
