The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A 25-YEAR-OLD man from West Nicholson will spend the next nine months in prison for having sexual intercourse with his 14-year-old girlfriend. Mlungisi Shili of Artherstone area in West Nicholson was convicted on his own plea of guilty to having sexual intercourse with a young person by Gwanda Provincial Magistrate, Mr Lungile Ncube. He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and three months were suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar offence within the next five years. Prosecuting, Miss Ethel Mahachi said Shili had sexual intercourse with the complainant, who cannot be named for ethical reasons, between February and June 17. She said the matter came to light when the complainant moved into Shili’s house. “Sometime in January, Shili proposed love to the complainant who turned down his proposal. “Shili persisted until the complainant changed her mind in February. Shili and the complainant started having sex in the same month up to June 17 at his home or at the complainant’s home when her parents were not around. “Their relationship came to light when the complainant, who is currently not attending school, went to Beitbridge to look for a job as a domestic worker. She failed to get a job and upon returning to her home area she went to stay with Shili for several days,” she said. Miss Mahachi said neighbours noticed the complainant and advised her to move out of Shili’s home as what she was doing was wrong. She said the complainant then went to her aunt’s home and told her about her relationship with Shili. Miss Mahachi said the complainant also revealed to her aunt that she had sexual intercourse with Shili on several occasions. She said the matter was reported to the police resulting in Shili’s arrest. In his defence, Shili said he did not know that the complainant was below 16 and she had consented to the sexual activities. — @DubeMatutu
