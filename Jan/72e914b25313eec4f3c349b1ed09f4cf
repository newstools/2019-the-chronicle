THE Gweru Mayor’s Christmas Cheer Fund on Friday distributed food vouchers worth $45 000 to different charity organisations and individuals from the city’s 16 Wards. Speaking during the distribution at the Gweru Civic Centre, the Mayor Councillor Josiah Solomon Makombe said the food vouchers were a belated Christmas present. “I am glad that we have raised about $45 000 for the 2018 Christmas Cheer Fund and we are giving away 600 food vouchers to less privileged people and charity organisations,” said Clr Makombe. He said in the past beneficiaries were given food hampers but this year they decided to give them food vouchers so that they can buy what they want from OK Supermarket. “We have since learnt that beneficiaries have different needs hence the decision to give them food vouchers. “The beneficiaries were drawn from the city’s 16 wards and organisations that benefited include Naran Centre in Ascot suburb and Mudavanhu School for physically and mentally challenged pupils in Mkoba 11,” said Clr Makombe. He said they could not distribute the vouchers last year as they were still receiving donations. “The food vouchers were supposed to be a Christmas present or box for the less privileged but had to be delayed by a month as we were waiting for more donations from individuals and corporates. I must say we are happy that we surpassed the previous year’s target,” said Clr Makombe. Chairperson of the organising committee Mr Victor Wasara said the cheer fund had also taken the initiative to pay school fees for identified pupils in need of school fees assistance.
