The Chronicle Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent A 24-year-old Masvingo man allegedly fatally stabbed a fellow congregate with a knife during a prayer vigil  following a dispute over badly cooked relish, police have confirmed. Tinos Mudyanembwa of Mutumwapasi Village under Chief Shumba allegedly stabbed Clever Guvuriro (28) of the same village once on the left side of the neck during prayers at their church deacon’s homestead. Masvingo police spokesperson Chief Inspector Charity Mazula said the incident occurred on Saturday at around 10 pm. She said the body of the deceased was taken to Masvingo General Hospital mortuary for post-mortem. “I can confirm receiving a report of murder involving congregates who had a prayer vigil at a homestead in Masvingo rural. The suspect has since been arrested and is expected to appear in court soon facing murder charges,” said Chief Insp Mazula. She said Clever Guvuriro and other congregates were at Mr Mutupo Madondo’s homestead for a prayer vigil when tragedy struck. “At around 8 pm, a 14-year-old boy allegedly served Clever Guvuriro and his friend, Mr Simbarashe Gumbochuma supper. Guvuriro mocked the boy saying the relish was poorly cooked and resembled women hair,” she said. This, she said, apparently irked the boy who advised Clever Guvuriro that he was supposed to be mindful of the church environment and his language was in bad taste. The man could not accept being reprimanded by the boy and in protest, repeatedly slapped him on the face until he fled. The boy, she said, reported the matter to his attacker‘s sibling, Mr Moses Guvuriro and Mudyanembwa. The two confronted Clever Guvuriro who was with his friend, Mr Gumbochuma and accused the pair of being a nuisance at church. Messrs Mudyanembwa and Moses Guvuriro teamed up and fought with the pair, Clever and Gumbochuma. Mudyanembwa allegedly drew an okapi knife from his pocket and stabbed Clever on the left side of the neck and he died minutes later. — @walterbmswazie2
