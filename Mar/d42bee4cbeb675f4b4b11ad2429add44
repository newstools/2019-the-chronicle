The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A MONTH after the demise of music legend Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi, his legacy is definitely living on as one of his apprentices, Donald Kanyuchi, will be releasing his debut album tomorrow. Kanyuchi, an afro contemporary musician who was one of the many students under Tuku’s Pakare Paye Music Academy, said the album, which comprises songs he penned with the assistance of the legend, would be launched at Pakare Paye Arts Centre in Norton. He will be joined on stage by Gary Tight and Agga Nyabinde. Having joined Pakare Paye as a bassist in 2008, Kanyuchi said Tuku taught him how to play the acoustic guitar. “I’ve just finished working on a 10-track album titled Ndinzwei. I should say its release comes with a heavy heart as Mdhara Tuku won’t be there to enjoy some of his fruits,” Kanyuchi said. Managed by Tuku’s Black Spirits bassist, Charles Njekesa, Kanyuchi said although he had no plans of including a Tuku tribute on this album, he has decided to work on a separate single for the man who gave him his first guitar. “We’re working with my manager to come up with a single in honour of Mdhara Tuku. He was my mentor and taught me to play an acoustic guitar. “He also introduced me to the world of live shows after he took me under his wing and made me an opening act for his shows across the country,” he said. The album, which was recorded and produced by Tarrie G Finger of Oreck Music, is social commentary which seeks to give hope to the neglected parts of society. “It’s about daily social life and it’s meant to inspire those that are disregarded in the society and give them hope.” Kanyuchi joins the likes of Mbeu, Innocent Mupemba, Gary Tight, Munya Mataruse and DJ Mbavu among a host of other artistes who were mentored by Tuku.
