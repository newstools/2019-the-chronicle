The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A MAID and her “Ben 10” gardener boyfriend from Bulawayo have been arrested for allegedly stealing property worth more than RTGS$80 000 from their employer. Nancy Ncube (44) and Ian Mansuka (28) allegedly stole from Ms Tamara Morrow (27) of Fourwinds suburb. The duo allegedly stole an Apple laptop, clothes, shoes, car radio, car jack, alarm system, pressure cooker, cosmetics, bathing towels and other property. Ncube and Mansuka pleaded not guilty to theft when they appeared before Bulawayo magistrate, Mr Lesego Ngwenya. The magistrate remanded them in custody to today for trial. The court heard that Ncube and Mansuka were lovers and they connived to steal from their employer. Prosecuting, Mr Average Masuka said sometime between August last year and August this year, Ncube and Mansuka allegedly stole property from Ms Morrow’s house in her absence. “The complainant noticed the disappearance of some of her property and asked the accused persons but they denied all knowledge about the said missing property,” he said. Ms Morrow reported the matter to the police. Ncube and Mansuka were identified as the only possible suspects as they were the only other people who had the keys to the house. Searches were made at the accused persons’ house in Hopeville suburb and property valued at RTGS$56 000 was recovered leading to their arrest.—@zinyuke98
