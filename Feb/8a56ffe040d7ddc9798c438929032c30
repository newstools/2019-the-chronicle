MAVERICKS extended their unbeaten run in the Bulawayo Basketball League by beating Highlanders A 64-50 at Khanyisile Sports Centre on Saturday. The Admose Ndlovu coached team has won all its six league matches. Ndlovu attributed the win to his players’ present mental toughness that enabled them to turn the game around in the dying minutes of the match. Highlanders A led for the first two quarters but failed to see out the game. Coach Theo Weale bemoaned his side’s missed chances but said they had learnt from their mistakes. “It is unfortunate we lost the match in the last five minutes of the game and this shows that the game was a tight contest. I had done my homework on how Mavericks play and I also worked on dealing with their offensive play, but things didn’t turn out as I had wished,” said Weale. He however said he was not going to change his game plan but work on the complacency. “Highlanders Basketball Club is alive and it’s high time our opponents feel our presence. We have resumed training and our focus is on ensuring we right the wrongs that we identified in our last encounter and hope to fare better in the coming matches,” Weale said.
