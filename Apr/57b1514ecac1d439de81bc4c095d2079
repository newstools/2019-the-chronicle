The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent LEISURE spot, Sports 747 in Bulawayo has had a major facelift that has made it more comfortable to revellers. The place which was closed for renovations for several months, only opened its doors to the public last Sunday. Popular for its braai facilities and quality meat, the outdoor spot has been one of the preferred spots especially during weekends. Its manager, Tshilidzi Muleya said the sprucing up of the place was in response to complaints from patrons who were saying the place was rundown, especially the bar. “We realised that most of the people liked our meat as it is top quality but after eating, they used to leave for other places for drinks because our place was not that comfortable,” Tshilidzi said. He said they decided to spend money to make the place not only comfortable but appealing as well. “We’ve also worked on the outside area to make it more comfortable for families. We’ve also expanded the seating area to cater for many people. We now have a serving area where people collect their orders,” said Tshilidzi. He said they were not done with the renovations as there were plans to expand the place. “In the future, we want to have a pavilion for people to sit. We want the place apart from having braai facilities and bar, to have conference facilities.” The leisure spot in the past used to host South African artistes such as DJ Fresh and Euphonic but this year, Tshilidzi said they will not be hosting shows.
