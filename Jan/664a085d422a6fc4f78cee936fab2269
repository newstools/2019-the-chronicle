HIGHLANDERS A produced a solid performance to inflict a 57-36 defeat on Giants in the Bulawayo Basketball League at Khanyisile Sports Centre on Saturday. It was a polished performance by Highlanders A as they stunned the defending champions into their first loss of the season. Bulawayo Basketball League promotions and marketing officer Francis Dube said Highlanders did not only draw large support in football, as their basketball outfit also has some voiceforous following. “They’re the most supported team in our league and I think it works to their advantage. The match was more or less a final for both teams because of the calibre of players they have,” said Dube. Giants cruised through the 2018 season to easily claim the title, but performances by other teams this season show that they won’t have it all their way. Highlanders A stand-in player coach Rodney Mane got a standing ovation from the crowd when he came on in the last quarter after superbly directing operations from the bench in the absence of coach Theo Weale. In other men’s matches, Maverick thumped Clippers 87-34, while Highlanders B dismissed Nust B 82-49. The only ladies’ match of the day saw Angels humbling Divas 63-17. Weekend Results
