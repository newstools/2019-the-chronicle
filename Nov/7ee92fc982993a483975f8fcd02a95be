The Chronicle Manchester United are desperate to get Alexis Sanchez off their books permanently, according to reports. The Chilean flop was sent out on loan to Inter Milan earlier this summer and went on to score one goal in his first three appearances. However, the 30-year-old’s return to the Serie A has since stalled after he suffered a serious ankle injury and he is not expected to make his return until the new year. According to The Athletic, United are hopeful that Inter will take him on permanently next summer, allowing them to raise funds for RB Salzburg starlet Erling Haaland. The 19-year-old forward has attracted interest from clubs in Europe after impressing in the Champions League and Austrian Bundesliga this season. And now United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has shown just how interested he is in Haaland by sending his “personal scout”, Simon Wells, to watch the teenage wonderkid. Solskjaer asked Wells from the club’s recruitment team to closely assess players who could strengthen his under-achieving squad earlier this season. The pair know each other well from his time as manager of Molde in Norway because Wells was United’s scout in the Scandinavia region at the time. Haaland has notched an exceptional 26 goals in 18 appearances for the Austrian outfit so far this season. — mailonline
