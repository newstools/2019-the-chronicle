TOP Zimbabwean professional golfer Scott Vincent is part of the field taking part in the $1 million SMBC Singapore Open which began yesterday at the Sentosa Golf Club’s Serapong Course. Vincent is one of the few Africans, who also includes South Africans Keith Horne, Jack Harding, Jbe’ Kruger and Shaun Norris, taking part in the season-opening event of the Asian Tour and Japan Golf Tour Organisation. Chinese Taipei’s Hung Chien-yao is leading the tourney after carding a five-under-par 66 to snatch the first round clubhouse lead. Together with the Japanese pair of Yuta Ikeda and Yoshinori, Philippines’ Miguel Tabuena also had a round to remember when he returned with a 67 to trail Hung by one shot. Meanwhile, a total of seven Zimbabwe’s professional golfers have entered the Eye of Africa golf championships qualifier on January 28 at the Eye of Africa Golf Estate. The players will be hoping to join Ryan Cairns, Mark Williams and Marc Cayuex who are already in the contest. The Mandhu siblings, Mohammad and Kayyam, will be joined by Sheldon Steyn, Brian Gondo, Robson Chinhoi, William Lake and Ben Follet-Smith. Follet-Smith is the highest ranked player among those who have shown interest in taking part in the event as he is on 918. Mahommad Mandhu is second on 2002 while Brian Gondo is on position 2007. Follet-Smith has so far participated in 14 tournaments.
