Civil Society and Churches Joint Forum (CSCJF) — a human rights organisation on Friday said MDC Alliance and its affiliate non-governmental organisations were to blame for the recent violent demonstrations that left six people, including a police officer dead. The human rights organisation said it was clear the demonstrations had a hidden political agenda yet its organisers were hiding behind fuel hikes and genuine labour issues which were being pursued by civil servants. It castigated those abusing the social media and unscrupulous businesspeople causing price distortions in the market. Addressing journalists in Harare yesterday, CSCJF national chairperson Reverend Anglistone Sibanda said nation building was everyone’s responsibility. “We condemn the organisers and instigators of the violent protests that were clearly planned and executed with a political objective hiding the genuine labour issues and we condemn the looting, wanton destruction of property, injury and loss of lives, bearing in mind the sanctity of human life,” he said. Rev Sibanda urged the civil society to support Government’s efforts in promoting peace in the country. “We call upon Government to act speedily in addressing the genuine currency issue and the civil servants salaries issue through tripartite negotiation forum so as to ensure service delivery for the general citizens,” he said. He said retailers should not unilaterally hike prices. “We implore the business community to be patriotic in their quest for profit and stop the culture of inflating prices of commodities that erodes the incomes of the poor people,” Rev Sibanda said.
