The Chronicle Auxilia Katongomara, Chronicle Reporter THE Bulawayo City Council has acquired water treatment chemicals to last over two months, a move which has averted a crisis for the local authority. BCC last month reported that stock levels of ammonia and chlorine were at a critical level with only a week’s supply for chlorine, one of the major chemicals required in water purification. In a statement yesterday, BCC Senior Public Relations Officer Mrs Nesisa Mpofu said the city had acquired the key chemicals. She said among the critical chemicals required, Council had acquired 974 tonnes of aluminium sulphate, five tonnes of chlorine and eight tonnes of HTH. Mrs Mpofu said council had put in place measures to ensure adequate and constant supply of the chemicals to avoid a crisis. “Contracts for 2019 have been signed for water treatment chemicals for delivery on an as and when basis. Residents are advised that the City is not in a crisis and the situation is under control,” she said. Turning to the issue of foreign currency which had affected the timely delivery of the water treatment chemicals, Mrs Mpofu said Council applies to exchange control authorities for foreign currency and they have been assisted accordingly. The local authority says it requires US$208 000 every month for water treatment chemicals with aluminium sulphate being the most expensive at US$183 950 each month followed by chlorine which requires US$16 000 monthly. Other chemicals used in water treatment are ammonia, polyelectrolyte, lime and HTH. Ammonia is used to assist chlorine in the disinfection process of water, while poly-electrolytes are used in the process of coagulation and flocculation which helps clear murky waters. The city is on a 48-hour weekly water shedding schedule in all suburbs and at times the period is extended to 72 hours.—@AuxiliaK
