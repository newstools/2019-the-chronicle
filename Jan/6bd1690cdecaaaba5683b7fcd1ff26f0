THIRTY soccer players have registered for the sixth edition of the Football Union of Zimbabwe (FUZ) out-of-contract players’ training camp which starts today in Bulawayo. Former national team coach Callisto Pasuwa who won the 2018 championship in Malawi with Nyasa Big Bullets will conduct the six-day programme to be held at Bulawayo’s Heath Streak Multi-Sports Centre alongside legends Agent Sawu and Mighty Warriors coach Sithethelelwe Sibanda. Herbert Dick, FUZ vice-president said they are ready to host the trials and called on footballers yet to register to come for the camp. “So far we’ve 30 players that have registered for the Bulawayo camp. We are anticipating the number to rise to between 50 and 100 footballers because we have also invited coaches from the Premier Soccer League and First Divisions to come and scout for talent. This is one opportunity that out of contract footballers can’t afford to miss because it provides a platform to get specialized training, life skills tips and possible chances of attracting clubs,” said Dick. The Bulawayo camp runs simultaneously with the Harare camp that will be headed by former Ngezi Platinum Stars gaffer Tonderai Ndiraya, Naison Muchekela and ex-Mighty Warriors coach Rosemary Mugadza. For this year’s edition, FUZ have also extended invites to women’s soccer players. Besides the players being taken through their paces at the comprehensive camp, FUZ has also invited physical trainers, administrators, referees and dieticians to talk to the players. The footballers union will also make presentations on contract negotiations, contractual obligations, health and hygiene and expectations of referees. Dick said they have also invited a sports doctor to talk on drug and alcohol abuse following concerns on footballers who are succumbing to peer pressure and are abusing substances like ‘bronco’ (BronCleer, a cough syrup), Diazepam and other drugs.
