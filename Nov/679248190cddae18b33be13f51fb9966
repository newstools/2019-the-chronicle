The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City FC need a point in their final game of the season against Arenel Movers to secure a Premiership ticket in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League. The municipal side did a smash and grab affair in Victoria Falls to edge Mosi Rovers 1-0 at the weekend, courtesy of a Canaan Nkomo strike early in the first-half. The victory took City’s points’ tally to 64 from 27 games and they enjoy a three-point lead over second-placed Talen Vision, who beat Casmyn 3-2 at home. “Everyone is happy that we managed to get maximum points against Mosi Rovers, who really gave us a good run. We worked hard for those points and I just want to praise the boys for the victory. Obviously needing a point on the last day means we have to carry the same mentality and go for a victory, we won’t rest,” said Try Ncube, City’s coach. Arenel Movers are heading to Zifa Bulawayo Province Division Two, as they are second from the bottom of the 15-team table with 20 points. Vision have a tricky end-of-season fixture against Makomo in Hwange. The coal miners stunned power generators ZPC Hwange 1-0 in a local derby at the weekend. Makomo’s win saw them dislodging ZPC Hwange, who are tied on 45 points with them, from third place due to a superior goal difference. Makomo are fighting for a top four finish.
