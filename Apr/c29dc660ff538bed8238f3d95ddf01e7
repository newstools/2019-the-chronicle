The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls DOMESTIC tourists visiting the Victoria Falls Rainforest will now pay RTGS$20 up from RTGS$7 after the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) reviewed entry fees to match the prevailing inter-bank exchange rate. The authority said the move was in response to the Monetary Policy announced by the Central Bank recently. Zimparks announced the entry fees adjustment in a statement. “Kindly note that all parks conservation fees including Rainforest entrance fees have been reviewed upwards with immediate effect. This is in compliance with RBZ’s introduction of new exchange rates between RTGS and the United States dollar,” read the statement. <img class="size-medium wp-image-443322" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Victoria-Falls-Rainforest-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Victoria-Falls-Rainforest-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Victoria-Falls-Rainforest-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Victoria-Falls-Rainforest-680x529.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Victoria-Falls-Rainforest.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Victoria Falls Rainforest Zimparks also collects entry fees into game parks. All along entry fees to the Rainforest were pegged at US$7 at a 1:1 rate with RTGS for locals.Those paying in US$ will continue paying $7. International entry fees remain unchanged between US$20 and US$30 depending on a client’s region of origin. The adjustment has attracted mixed reactions from locals with some accusing Zimparks of making the Rainforest expensive. Over the years domestic tourism has been playing second fiddle to international tourism. Some said locals will not be able to enter the Rainforest. Zimparks said the charges in the previous tariff were calculated basing on the USD and was now being rated according to the prevailing RBZ exchange rate. Contacted for comment, Zimparks spokesperson Mr Tinashe Farawo said the adjustment was not a fee hike. “We’re not increasing the price on our products in Victoria Falls and other places throughout the country. As an authority we are sensitive to the concerns of our clients and markets that’s why we are going all out to ensure that we increase our market share in terms of domestic tourism,” Mr Farawo said. “We’re simply realigning with the current situation when it comes to the issue of currency. We’re concerned to ensure that we have more people who visit and view what we have as a country”. The tourism industry has been identified as a low hanging fruit with a potential to transform the country’s economy. – @ncubeleon.
