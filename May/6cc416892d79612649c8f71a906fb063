The Chronicle Twitter Responses to “UK sacks minister who planned to invade Zim” Kudos to British Prime Minister Theresa May for taking a bold stance of sacking her Secretary of State for Defence, who was planning to invade our beautiful country Zimbabwe, and at least four other African countries, and possibly declare war on China. In this century colonialist tendencies should not be tolerated under any circumstances. I thank the British PM for the bravery and sending a clear message to all those who have such selfish minds and do not respect the independence of other nations. – @MunyaNdumz. Responses to “Ultimatum for NatPharm bosses” It is encouraging to learn that the New Dispensation is no longer tolerating lazy civil servants as it put it bluntly that it will fire NatPharm bosses, who are withholding medicine at their warehouse at the expense of the many sick people in the country. Many are losing their lives due to the unavailability of medicines in hospitals and clinics, and it is worrisome to know that medicine is stored in warehouses where it may even expire before use. Please minister, deal with these unruly elements who only care about themselves. – online
