The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO-based player Zamani Moyo breezed past top seed Kumal Mohammed 6-4, 6-2 to win the Under-18 boys’ 2019 Harare Junior Tennis Open on Sunday. It was a deserved win for Moyo who missed out on the Botswana and Namibia tours due to lack of funding . His coach Mkhululi George Sibanda said the 16-year-old Moyo effectively played excellent sharp volleys that led to his victory. “He had wanted to improve his current ranking in the International Tennis Federation junior circuit in Botswana and despite his failure to travel, winning the Harare Open was a huge consolation and inspiration,” said Sibanda. After his singles win, Moyo partnered Farai Mareya from Mutare to lift the doubles gong with a 4-6, 6-3, 11-9 victory over Tinaye Kaswa and Mohammed. “Zamani’s performance proves that with more exposure and consistent quality training, he has the potential to reach greater heights,” said Sibanda. Among the Bulawayo contingent that participated in the tournament are rising talent Emmly Leboganag (8). Sibanda encouraged parents and coaches to enter more players into these tournaments as they aid in developing their game. – @DecoDecent2.
