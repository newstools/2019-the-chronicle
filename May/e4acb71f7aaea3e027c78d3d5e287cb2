The Chronicle Cape Town — Not content with winning back to back Premier League titles, Pep Guardiola is reportedly targeting as many as four new faces in a £200 million Manchester City spending spree. Guardiola wants to ‘freshen up’ his squad with a defender, two midfielders and a striker, according to a report in the Daily Mail. Atletico Madrid central midfielder Rodri is a major target, as City look for a long-term replacement for soon to be 34-year-old stalwart Fernandinho. Indeed, sporting director Txiki Begiristain is said to have made a personal check on the 22-year-old Spain international, who has a £60 million release clause. City have also been keeping tabs on Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic, while there is interest in Benfica’s outstanding 19-year-old Joao Felix. Jovic, who impressed in both legs of the Europa League semi-finals against Chelsea, is valued at around £50m but is also a target for Real Madrid — although Frankfurt are desperate to keep the forward if they qualify for Europe again this season. Mail sources also suggest that City’s decision to call off the pursuit of Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell is down to prioritising a new centre-back. While there has been interest in Liverpool and Manchester United target Matthijs de Ligt, Guardiola feels that it will be too difficult to land the Ajax star — given that Barcelona are the frontrunners for the player. Guardiola is a big admirer of Leicester and England star Harry Maguire, but could also move for another playmaker in Lyon’s Houssem Aouar if Ilkay Gundogan decides to move on. The threat of an impending transfer ban means City are trying to get their business done as quickly as possible, although any such ban is unlikely to be enforced this summer. Meanwhile, City stars who are being tipped to leave included the likes of Nicolas Otamendi, Fabian Delph and Eliaquim Mangala. — Sport24
