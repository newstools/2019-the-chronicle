The Chronicle DURBAN (AFP) — Stalwart prop, Tendai “Beast” Mtawarira, will make history this week as he equals Adriaan Strauss’ record as the most capped South African Super Rugby player. Zimbabwe-born Mtawarira has been named in the starting line-up for tomorrow’s clash against the Bulls at Kings Park. After this match, Mtawarira and Strauss would have both featured in 156 Super Rugby fixtures. Retired Crusaders prop, Wyatt Crockett, holds the overall record with 202 matches played for the nine-time champions. Strauss represented the Cheetahs and then the Bulls, but Mtawarira has accomplished this record for just one team, the Sharks, since making his debut in 2007 and will break the record South African record in his next appearance. Teams Sharks: 15 Aphelele Fassi, 14 Lwazi Mvovo, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Andre Esterhuizen 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Robert du Preez, 9 Louis Schreuder (captain), 8 Daniel du Preez, 7 Jacques Vermeulen, 6 Luke Stringer, 5 Hyron Andrews, 4 Ruben van Heerden, 3 Coenie Oosthuizen, 2 Akker van der Merwe, 1 Tendai Mtawarira Substitutes: 16 Craig Burden, 17 Thomas du Toit, 18 Khutha Mchunu, 19 Gideon Koegelenberg, 20 Philip van der Walt, 21 Grant Williams, 22 Kobus van Wyk, 23 Curwin Bosch
