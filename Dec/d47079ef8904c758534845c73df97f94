The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A GROUP of touts and cross border transport operators has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a Zupco bus driver. Philani Nkala (32), Fredrick Moyo (30), Clifford Chirwa (30) all from Gwanda and Blessmore Dube (26), Mandla Moyo (24), Mduduzi Moyo (39) and Lancelot Moyo (23) from Bulawayo were not asked to plead when they appeared before Gwanda magistrate, Mrs Nomagugu Sibanda, facing public violence charges. They were granted $300 bail to December 20 on condition that they stay at their given addresses, do not interfere with State witnesses and report once every Friday at police stations near them. In addition Chirwa, Dube, Mandla, Mduduzi and Lancelot were ordered to surrender their passports as they are cross-border transport operators. Representing the State, Miss Glenda Nare who opposed bail said the accused persons were facing a serious offence and since some were cross-border transport operators, they could skip the country. She said the gang assaulted Mr Justice Sanya on December 4 after they found him parked at Engen Garage in Gwanda where he was loading passengers that were going to Beitbridge. Miss Nare said the accused persons ganged up against Mr Sanya and kicked and punched him several times. She said they dragged him into the Gwanda- Beitbridge Highway and further assaulted him. Miss Nare said the accused persons further uttered sentiments that “This Mnangagwa Zanu-PF bus must be set on fire”. She said the accused persons stopped assaulting Mr Sanya after they saw a haulage truck approaching.
