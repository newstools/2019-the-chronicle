The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THE search for the next Miss Tourism Zimbabwe (MTZ) queen continues tomorrow and on Friday in Bulawayo as the province holds its regional auditions at the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority offices. The auditions will run from 2PM to 5PM on both days. The ZTA offices are situated between 9th and 10th avenues along Robert Mugabe Way. Last year the province failed to land the national crown as the provincial queen did not make the cut in the national finals. MTZ Bulawayo regional licence holder, Nobesuthu Masango, said: “We are really hoping that this year many aspiring models will come in their numbers for the auditions. Lately it seems there are a lot of models who are interested in participating in the pageant so we shall see what happens come auditions”. <img class="size-medium wp-image-444472" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Miss-Tourism-Zimbabwe-257x360.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="360" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Miss-Tourism-Zimbabwe-257x360.jpg 257w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Miss-Tourism-Zimbabwe-768x1075.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Miss-Tourism-Zimbabwe-486x680.jpg 486w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Miss-Tourism-Zimbabwe.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px" /> Miss Tourism Zimbabwe auditions The dress code for the Bulawayo auditions is heels, black jeans and a white top. Other requirements for the models are that they should be between 18 to 24 years old and be at least 1.67 metres tall. Meanwhile, in the Midlands province, the auditions went well according to MTZ licence holder, Mavis Koslek. However, she appealed to the corporate world to help the pageant move forward. “I’m appealing to corporates from all the corners of the Midlands and beyond to partner with Miss Tourism Midlands, through sponsorship. They can use Miss Tourism Midlands as a platform to market their brands in the pageant through beauty and tourism in the Midlands province.” She said the team travelled to Kwekwe, Gweru and Zvishavane with 22 models making the provisional list. “I travelled widely to cast Miss Tourism Zimbabwe Midlands’ auditions during the weekend. There were 22 models, Gweru had the most with 10 followed by Kwekwe six, Zvishavane had three, Gokwe two and Zhombe had one,” said Koslek. “A final selection will result in short listing. The cut will be determined by the girls’ behaviour, etiquette and discipline during the build up to the pageant.”
