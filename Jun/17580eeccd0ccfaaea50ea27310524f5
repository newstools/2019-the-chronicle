The Chronicle Jose Mourinho could be about to return to Stamford Bridge as manager of Chelsea for a third time. The Blues’ current boss Maurizio Sarri is edging closer to joining Serie A champions Juventus. This means the west London club are in a race against time to find the right person to take control. According to The Sun, Mourinho is seriously considering a third spell in charge of Chelsea. The Portuguese boss said in March that he hoped to be back in management in June. Blues legend Frank Lampard is still the favourite to takeover but the Chelsea board are looking at managers with top-flight experience. Former Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri, Ajax’s Erik ten Hag, Nuno Espirito Santo at Wolves and Watford’s Javi Gracia are also fairly high in the betting. Sarri is waiting for the final say from Chelsea before getting the go-ahead to complete his return to Italy, which is partly reliant on the Europa League winners finalising their own succession plan. Mourinho might now have provided a tempting offer for Chelsea, as he is eager to get back into work since being sacked by Manchester United in December. The 56-year-old has been doing some punditry work on beIN SPORTS while he waits for the right job. Mourinho won three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and three League Cups during two spells at Stamford Bridge. His last stint in charge ended on a sour note as he was sacked following a poor start to his league title defence. This came on the back of his row with then-club doctor Eva Carneiro over her going on to the pitch to treat Eden Hazard during the season-opening 2-2 draw with Swansea. If Mourinho does return he may be hamstrung in the transfer market as the Blues are currently banned from registering new players for two windows. The London club have submitted an appeal to CAS to grant an interim ruling. — mailonline
