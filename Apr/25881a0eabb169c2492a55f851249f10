MATABELELAND North province’s 28-member National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) chess team is hoping to leave a lasting impression at the national finals that start in Masvingo today. The national championships are being held at Victoria High School and will end on Sunday. The provincial squad, selected at an event at Fatima High School a fortnight ago, is dominated by learners from David Livingstone with six participants and it held a three-day camp that ended at Milton High yesterday. Matabeleland North provincial head-in-charge of chess Tirison Cheteni, the headmaster of Pashu High School in Binga, said they were working on the players’ shortcomings. “The camp has been helpful to the participants because we got some of the experienced coaches to work on certain aspects with them, which include concentration. Right now I think players will be able to last the games, because some games stretch for three hours. I believe our chances of doing well in Masvingo are bright,” said Chiteni. – @ZililoR.
