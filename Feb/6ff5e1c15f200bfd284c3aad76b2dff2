A WOMAN collapsed and died in Bulawayo yesterday afternoon while attending to a customer at a local fabric retail shop where she worked. The incident occurred at a shop along Herbert Chitepo, between Leopold Takawira and Eighth avenues at around midday. The cause of death or the woman’s identity could not be established immediately. Bulawayo police spokesperson Chief Inspector Precious Simango said police are still gathering information surrounding the matter and the deceased’s next of kin are yet to be informed. She said more information will be availed today. Eyewitnesses said the woman dropped dead in front of a customer who was inquiring about fabric prices. “The woman just collapsed while attending to a customer and a co-worker called an ambulance,” narrated the witness who declined to be named. “She was declared dead as soon as the ambulance crew arrived. We all don’t know what was the cause of death.” The body was being taken away by police as a Chronicle news crew arrived at the scene. This news crew could not get a comment from the business owners as they locked themselves inside the shop. — @esinathy_essira/@sharonbuwe
