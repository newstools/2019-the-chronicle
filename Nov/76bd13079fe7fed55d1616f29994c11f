The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent NEXT month rappers Asaph, T Gonzi and King 98 will battle it out at the Zimbabwe Hip Hop Awards as the trio has a total of 20 nominations. The hip hop awards will be held at the Wood Sensation (at the Long Chen Plaza in Harare) on December 13 with the who’s who of the local hip hop scene expected to gather there. Topping the nominees list is newcomer King 98 with seven nominations in the Best Male, Best Album (Francesca), Song of the Year for his collaboration with South Africa’s Nasty C on Wakco, Best Music video for the same track, Hip Hop Hustle, Personality of the Year and People’s Choice categories. Bulawayo’s Asaph, who scooped three awards last year, has six nominations in the Best Male, Best Album (People’s Rapper), Best hip hop verse, Song of the Year (Vibe is Correct), Hip Hop Personality of the Year and People’s Choice categories. Ti Gonzi, who has also been putting in a lot of hard work this year, has earned himself seven nominations, largely because of his hit track, Kure, which features Ishan. The song is nominated for Song of the Year, Video of the year and Best Collaboration. Ti Gonzi has also been nominated in the Best Male, Best Hip Hop verse, Best Hip hop hustle and People’s Choice categories. Another up-and-coming artiste, Msiz’kay is also in the mix with three nominations in Best Newcomer, Best Producer and Best alternative categories. Zim hip hop awards founder, Adrian “Beefy” Harrison, said this year’s theme “Culture Over Everything” was meant to educate the artistes about the hip hop genre. “Hip hop is all about culture and one can’t succeed in the genre without knowing and living the culture. So, in laymen’s terms, it means if you’re a hip hop artiste, you need to respect the genre and where you come from for you to succeed. “The hip hop culture is our only identity,” said Beefy.
