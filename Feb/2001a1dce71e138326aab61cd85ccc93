SIMBISA Brands has opened its first Pizza Inn branch in Gwanda and a second Chicken Inn branch in the mining town. In an interview during the official opening of the new outlets yesterday, Chicken Inn and Pizza Inn operations Manager for Gwanda, Miss Sibongulwazi Mpofu said the move was meant to bring services closer to the people. “We opened our first Chicken Inn branch at Glow Garage in Gwanda in 2015 and today we are officially opening our second branch plus our first Pizza Inn branch here at Engen G arage. “We decided to bring services closer to our clients here in Gwanda who have continued to support us,” she said. Miss Mpofu said people had to travel to as far as Bulawayo for pizza hence the decision to open the Pizza Inn in Gwanda. “Our branch has a staff complement of about 30 people and all these workers are from Gwanda. We strongly believe in empowering the people and giving back to the community we operate in,” said Miss Mpofu. She said they had received positive response from the public since the opening of the new business. A resident from Gwanda, Mrs Lethukuthula Moyo expressed excitement over the new branch saying she had long awaited to have Pizza Inn opened in the town. “We are happy that our town finally has Pizza Inn and that there is now another Chicken Inn branch. Our town is busy as it’s along the highway to South Africa hence the need for such services,” she said. — @DubeMatutu.
