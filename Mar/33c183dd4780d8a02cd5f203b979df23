The Chronicle Showbiz Reporters GOSPEL musicians in Bulawayo have united for a concert meant to assist Cyclone Idai victims. After the success of the Harare concert last Sunday at City Sports Centre, organisers decided to hold one in the City of Kings. It will be held at the Harvest House International Church building (6th Avenue and Fife Street) on Saturday with admission being a donation to the Cyclone Idai victims (money, foodstuffs or clothes). Entertainment will be provided by Vocal Ex, Lorraine Stot, Mai Mwamuka, Sipho Snowy, Vuyo Brown, Faith Mucha, Blessing Mokoena, Nathan and Felix Elishua as well as Gospel Music Association United. Senior Reverend, Dr Sarah Nyathi, will be a special guest at the concert and will take time to pray for the nation. Co-ordinator of the concert Blessing Stot said they found it prudent for Bulawayo artistes to also give a helping hand to the victims. “This is a tragedy that has befallen our countrymen and we felt it imperative for us to help,” said Stot. He said they do not have a set target but they are hoping to get mostly food which the over 40 000 people who were displaced by the floods are in need of. “People can bring whatever they deem necessary for the victims. But according to information we’ve gathered, the people need food. However, everything else is welcome and even Econet has given us an EcoCash number where people can send money to,” said Stot. The EcoCash code is 322274 and the name is Gospel Music Association United. In the near future, Stot said they will be holding another concert in Gweru for Midlands’ gospel artistes. According to the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Cyclone Idai has claimed 172 people in Zimbabwe, while 99 have been buried with 327 missing. Meanwhile, more gospel musicians Mathias Mhere, Agatha Murudzwa, Bethany Pasinawako-Ngolomi, Sisters of Paradise and Prophet Tapiwa Freddy are billed to uplift souls when they perform at the “Spiritual Spectacles Night” on Friday. <img class="size-medium wp-image-442418" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Mathias-Mhere-360x240.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Mathias-Mhere-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Mathias-Mhere-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Mathias-Mhere-680x453.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Mathias-Mhere.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Mathias Mhere The second edition of the night of praise and worship will be taking place at White City Stadium and is being hosted by the Goodness and Mercy Ministries (GMM), led by Prophet Tapiwa Freddy. The event is expected to begin at 8PM. Prophet Freddy said: “We’re expecting a larger crowd as there’s been great demand for the Spiritual Spectacles Night in Bulawayo. Despite the performances, we’ll also be preaching the word of God as well as changing lives.” Mhere said he would use this event to unveil a new song that he penned for Cyclone Idai victims. “I wrote a song for the people who were affected by the Cyclone and the people of Bulawayo will be the first to hear it. We’ll also use this event to pray for those who were affected by the cyclone,” said Mhere. Bulawayo gospel group Sisters of Paradise said they would touch souls with their powerful music which is a source of healing. “We hope that the messages in our songs will have an impact on people’s lives. People should therefore make their way to White City Stadium in their numbers as we’ll be praising and worshipping the Almighty.”
