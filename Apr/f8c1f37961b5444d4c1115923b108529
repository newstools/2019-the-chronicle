I also hope to get pointers about the industry from them,” she said. For now, the AEIOU hit-maker is working on her album Love Bitter and Sweet which she said is almost complete. She hopes to release it in August. “In this project, I’m experimenting with various sounds including reggae, soul, deep houz, soul houz and jazz so people should definitely expect a new sound from me.” To add more flavour, Seagirl will be collaborating with several local artistes as well as two foreign artistes on this album.
