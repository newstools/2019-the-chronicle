WORLD Boxing Federation (WBF) All-Africa heavyweight champion Elvis Moyo has set aside 12 tickets for Zimbabweans who will be in South Africa next month when he fights Ruan Visser in a 10-round non-title fight at Sun Arena in Pretoria. The Zimbabwean heavyweight champion, who is promoting his bill, said the tickets are “only” for his countrymen who will be in South Africa when he fights South African Visser on February 10. “It’s always nice to have your people backing you and as a way of thanking my fellow Zimbabweans, I’m giving away 12 tickets to those who will be visiting South Africa between February 9 and 12. To win the tickets, the promotion will be posted on my Facebook wall and please note that this is specifically for people who will be travelling to South Africa from Zimbabwe for their business. As for Zimbabweans based in South Africa, I’ll be running a promotion where they can get tickets at discounted rates,” said Moyo. Moyo’s bout dubbed “Battle of the Warriors” is being promoted by 5th Element Promotions. He returns to the ring after 10 months of inactivity, with his last fight being against Ukrainian pugilist Pedyura Maksym, whom he floored in April last year. The fight with Visser will be Moyo’s fourth since winning the World Boxing Federation All-Africa heavyweight title on August 25, 2017, when he beat Ghana’s Bernard Adie. He followed it up with a successful title defence against Congolese Knife Didier at the City Sports Centre in Harare in January 2018. He went on to trade leather with Maksym. The Bulawayo Bomber’s scheduled November 2018 bill against Alick Godogo was cancelled and he is happy to face Visser in a bout he believes will open up more avenues for him. Moyo has been doing eight-round sparring sessions which he hopes to take to 10 by the end of the week as he prepares to knock out Visser. — @ZililoR
