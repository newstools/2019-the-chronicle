The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent WHEN dancing to Prince Kaybee’s latest album, one is reminded of how far the man has come. This is what his fans in Bulawayo experienced during his performance at Cosmopolitan Night Club on Tuesday where the musician launched his 13-track album. Titled Re Mmino, the album contains tracks such as Banomoya, Fetch your life and Club Controller. It’s been four years since Prince Kaybee burst on the scene with the Better Days album that went gold. Re Mmino which means we are music, speaks to the way the artiste has taken his music from being a personal journey to one which he is now sharing with his fans. The album is a mixture of soulful house in songs such as The Weekend to dance tracks such as Afro Thursday and Gqom in Banomoya. Basically, it has everything for everyone. During his performance, he rolled back the years and performed tracks such as Wajellwa. However, his set, for some revellers, was too short as they wanted him to perform more. Some also felt that his did not have much spark. The other revellers however had the time of their lives as they sang and danced along to every song he played.
