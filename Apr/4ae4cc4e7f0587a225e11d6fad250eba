The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter MORE than 40 learners participated in a three-day tennis development tournament in Colleen Bawn organised by the Gwanda Tennis Academy at the weekend. The tournament was contested in the Under-10, Under-12, Under-14 and Under-18 categories. Participants were drawn from Senondo, Jahunda, St Christopher’s, Gwanda Adventist, Portland, Colleen Bawn, Sabiwa Primary and Gwanda High and Emakhandeni Tennis Club. Tournament director Archbald Dungeni said: “It was a dipstick on progress, bringing together players from both primary and secondary schools around Gwanda. We also had guest players from Elite Tennis Village and Emakhandeni participating. The tournament not only allowed parents to watch their kids in action, but provided a platform for corporate sponsors, parents and event organisers to interact. There was commitment to sponsor future events, which is a big plus in sustaining efforts to develop the game. Parents on their part also appreciated the effort and pledged to support the players in their development.”
