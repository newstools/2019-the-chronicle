The Chronicle Mkhululi Ncube, Chronicle Reporter GOVERNMENT has extended the Measles-Rubella vaccination campaign in Bulawayo to monthend amid indications that so far more than 56 000 children in the city have been vaccinated. The Ministry of Health and Child Care carried out the Measles-Rubella campaign nationally initially from the September 23 to September 27. After that, a mop up exercise was done over the weekend targeting children who had not been vaccinated in the initial five days that had been set aside for the campaign. The campaign targeting children aged from six months to five years in which Vitamin A supplementation is also being administered has since been extended to October 31 with a call to parents and guardians to take their children to health centres to be vaccinated. In an emailed response to questions from Chronicle, Bulawayo city council senior public relations officer Mrs Nesisa Mpofu said during the first phase of the campaign more than 56 000 children were vaccinated. “The City of Bulawayo through the Health Services Department, on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Child Care, with partners, sister health institutions and schools participated in the vaccination campaign which was targeting 75 650 children for vaccination,” she said. “After the two intensive campaigns the ministry has further extended the period whereby all children between the ages of 9 months and 59 months (less than 5 years) are being offered this vaccination for free at all the City Council clinics. This exercise will continue till 31st October 2019. As of 16th October 2019, 56 730 (75%) children have been vaccinated.” Mrs Mpofu urged residents whose children have not been vaccinated to visit nearby council clinics to protect them from the risk of contracting measles and rubella. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said measles is making a “dangerous” comeback jolting authorities to vaccinate children. — @themkhust_ncube
