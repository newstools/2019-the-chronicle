HIGHLANDERS and Caps United supporters will face off in a friendly social match that is meant to cement relations between the two teams. The two supporters groups had arranged their inaugural clash this past Saturday at Municipal grounds in Bulawayo but the encounter was cancelled due to heavy rains that pounded the City and its now likely to be played this coming Saturday at the same venue . “We just thought of having this match as a way of reaching out to each other and also promoting sporting relations amongst us fans. We have previously done that with Dynamos supporters and this time we thought of engaging our Caps United counterparts and they also embraced the idea. We believe such gestures also help in mobilising support for our individual teams and also reduce hooliganism during matches,” said Progress Ndlovu, one of the organisers of the match. He said they will continue having such games especially on the eve of the two teams’ league matches.
