The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Kazungula BIKERS from Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe will today compete in a racing competition in Victoria Falls whose purpose is to raise funds for wildlife conservation. The race is a multi-faceted and dynamic motor cycling discipline whereby bikers ride up and down mountainous terrain outside Victoria Falls. It is in its seventh year and Botswana’s Ryan Clemence is the defending champion after winning the race last year. He finished second in 2017. Yesterday team Namibia and team Botswana entered the country through Kazungula Border post ahead of the two-day event. The South African bikers were expected later in the day yesterday. The race will start from the gorges on the Zambezi River with the route meandering around Chisuma, Sizinda and surrounding areas. Organised by Zambezi Off Road Bikers Club, the race has three categories namely advanced loop race, junior loop race and fun ride loop. The highlight of the competition will be seven-year old Leon Stiebock from Botswana who will be taking part in the junior loop race. His trainer is Clemence, the defending champion. The young rider said: “I was inspired by uncle Ryan and I thought I should give it a try.” His mother Kristin Stiebock said they bought him the bike last year when he showed interest in the race. Clemence has taken part in five editions of the race. He said the 2019 race will be the most difficult as there is stiff competition. “I feel very good but I am aware of the international talent that’s coming from Namibia and South Africa. This is going to be competitive,” he said. Ross Branch from Botswana who is coming for the third time said he prepared well for the race. From Namibia, the duo of Jochen Beckert and Henner Rusch said they look forward to a good weekend. Organisers of the event said they were happy with response. The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) was yesterday facilitating entry for the bikers at the borders. — @ncubeleon
