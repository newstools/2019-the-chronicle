The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent POLICE in Bulawayo have said residents in the western suburbs are reluctant to utilise the house under surveillance scheme where a person travelling out of town notifies police so they monitor their home. Bulawayo acting police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said cops have realised that residents in western suburbs hardly utilise the facility resulting in break-ins at their homes when they are away. “We are just coming from the Independence and Easter holidays but we have realised that residents living in western suburbs are not taking up our house under supervision scheme. The house under supervision scheme does not necessarily mean that if one informs us of their travelling arrangements we will deploy officers to be stationed in their homes. But when officers are conducting patrols they will be making surveillance into their homes,” said Insp Ncube. “It is however of concern to us that most city residents in western suburbs are not taking up the house under surveillance scheme seriously as a security measure. This has resulted in more houses in western suburbs being broken into while the occupants are away.” He gave an example of how thieves last year broke into a house and stole all property inside without neighbours raising alarm as they were not aware the home owner was out of town. “Apart from the house under surveillance scheme we also want to urge members of the public to at least inform one of the neighbours about their journeys. There is at least a neighbour that someone trusts whom they can inform about their travelling instead of just disappearing,” he said. — @nqotshili
