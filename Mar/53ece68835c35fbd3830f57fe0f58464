The Chronicle Bridgette Moyo in Gweru
MIDLANDS Christian College sprinter Elizabeth Msipa has made it into the team that will represent Zimbabwe at the African Junior Championships to be held in Cote d’Ivoire from April 16-20. Msipa (15), who is in Form 4 at the Gweru school, made the team after clocking a personal best time of 12.34 seconds in winning her 100m dash in qualifiers held at National Sports Stadium. Msipa said she was excited to be part of Team Zimbabwe for the Cote d’Ivoire Meet. “I’m so happy to be part of the selected team and am hoping to improve on my time before the meet because my aim is to return home with a medal. Right now all my weekends are busy as I’m also committed to school events until April,” said Msipa. She feels the weather will be a challenge in Cote d’Ivoire at the time of the event, as it is likely to be hot and dry. Team Zimbabwe will only arrive in the West African country three days before the event, which Msipa feels won’t give her and her teammates adequate time to acclimatise. “I think three days will be limited for me to adjust as this is my first trip to West Africa. If only the national association could allow us to go earlier it would better for us because we want to bring medals home,” she said. Her coach Leon Chimbuya said they will engage in a very competitive international meet before the African Junior Championships. “We will be in South Africa at the PUK McArthur Stadium in Potchefstroom on March 13 for the PUMA School of Speed competitions and we are taking that competition with the seriousness it deserves as it is part of the preparation we have en route to Cote d’Ivoire,” said Chimbuya. “This meet will help Msipa prepare for Cote d’Ivoire as she is set to jet off on April 13 with the rest of Team Zimbabwe which is made up of other athletes from around the country.”
