A 25-YEAR-OLD till operator from a leading supermarket in Gweru committed suicide by hanging on Sunday evening after a fight with her boyfriend who accused her of infecting him with HIV. This was after the man tested positive of the virus. Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko confirmed that Nothando Mutangi of Athlone suburb in Gweru committed suicide on Sunday around 10PM. “I can confirm that police are investigating the sudden death of a 25-year-old woman who was working at a local supermarket who was found hanging in her bedroom on Sunday,” he said. Mutangi’s sister Iris also confirmed the death of her younger sibling in an interview yesterday. “Nothando is no more, she committed suicide on Sunday after fighting with her boyfriend. Funeral arrangements are underway. She will be buried at our rural home in Mabasa Village, Zvishavane probably tomorrow (today),” she said The name of Nothando’s boyfriend could not be ascertained by the time of going to press. Gweru magistrate Ms Mildred Matuvi waived postmortem for Nothando’s remains at the request of her family which is not suspecting any foul play. “Circumstances of death indicate that the deceased person hanged herself after engaging in a heated conflict with her boyfriend who was alleging that the deceased infected him with HIV. The deceased hanged herself in her bedroom using a cloth. No foul play is suspected,” reads the waiver report. Meanwhile, Insp Goko urged members of the public to respect the sanctity of life saying the police, the church leadership and community elders were there to assist if any person is in need of counselling. “People should not consider suicide as that is no means of solving problems. Any type of problem can be fixed one way or the other and people should not resort to committing suicide as it is wrong,” he said.
