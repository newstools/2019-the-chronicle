The Chronicle Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau HIGHLANDERS have already dropped four points in their opening two matches of the season and coach Madinda Ndlovu has challenged his men to start winning games. Bosso turned on one of their best performances, in recent years, in the first half of their Battle of the Cities showdown against Caps United at Barbourfields on Sunday. They hit the post twice with skipper, Prince Dube, a threat with his pace. But, they faded badly in the second half and, by the end of that contest, were just hanging on to their point. Bosso were unbeaten in a league match in Harare last season. “We always play to win games but winning games is not just by word of mouth, it’s about the procedures that you would have gone through in preparation for the season,” said Madinda. “Basically, we do not train for one game, we train for the whole season. “We are psyched up and hyped in terms of our fitness and tactical preparations. We have a full complement of the squad. “Our biggest worry is that we have not yet attained a level where we are supposed to be in terms of fitness. “The team is responding well to the philosophy that I want. I think flashes of what I want are showing. New players are adapting well.” Highlanders have been boosted by the return of their Zambian striker, Peter Nyirenda, who missed last week’s match against the Green Machine due to an ankle injury. Bukhosi Sibanda and Bukhosi Ncube have also recovered. Ngezi Platinum Stars will be looking to halt Hwange’s fine run at the Colliery tomorrow. The Mhondoro side have a new mentor, Erol Akbay, and came from behind to pick maximum points against Mushowani Stars. Hwange have won their first two matches, including a memorable 2-1 win over Dynamos at Rufaro last Saturday.
