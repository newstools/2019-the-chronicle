A GWANDA-based veterinary officer has appeared in court for allegedly causing the death of three people after the vehicle he was driving rammed into a tree. Melusi Ndlovu (39), who stays in Ultra High Suburb, was not asked to plead when he appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Miss Lerato Nyathi, facing a charge of culpable homicide. He was remanded out of custody to January 24. Prosecuting, Miss Faith Mutukwa said Ndlovu, who is a holder of a Class Four and Class Five driver’s licences, was travelling from Gwanda Town to Guyu with four passengers onboard when he lost control of the vehicle. She said Glynns Maphosa (30), Nhlanhla Ndlovu (30) and Sabelo Ndlovu (24) — all from Paye Village in Guyu — died on the spot while Mbuso Ndlovu, who is also from the same area, sustained injuries. — @DubeMatutu.
