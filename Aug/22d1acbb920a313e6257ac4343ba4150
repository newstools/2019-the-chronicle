The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A 25-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for raping his neighbour’s two minor daughters. The man, whose name has been withheld to protect the identity of the minors, pleaded guilty to three counts of rape when he appeared before Bulawayo regional magistrate, Mr Joseph Mabeza. The magistrate sentenced him to an effective 15 years in prison. “The first two counts will be treated as one count. You have been sentenced to 20 years in prison for two counts of rape of which five years have been suspended for five years on condition that you do not commit a similar offence within that period,” Mr Mabeza said. Prosecuting, Mr Jeremiah Mutsindikwa said between September and November last year at around 1PM when the juveniles would have knocked off from school, the man would barge into their bedroom and rape them when they were changing their uniforms. He said the two sisters were alone at their home when they were raped. The court heard that the two victims told their grandmother that they were raped by the accused person and the matter was reported to the police leading to the man’s arrest.
