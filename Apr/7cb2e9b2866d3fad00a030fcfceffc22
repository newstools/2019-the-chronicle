The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma SHINSOMAN and Hwinza of the Lula Lula fame will be in Zvishavane this weekend where they are billed to headline the Midlands Fiesta. The event will be held at Club Vatican on Friday with the duo set to be joined on stage by Bazooka, Garry B and Templeman. On the decks will be DJs Jacha, Jebo and Touch. For Shinsoman, who has been out of action for a while, this show will be one to test his popularity as the up-and-coming Zimdancehall artistes have taken over the genre. â€“ @mthabisi_mthire
