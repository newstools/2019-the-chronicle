The Chronicle Response to “President to meet Advisory Council”. It’s good to have ideas from experts. They can bring a change to our economy. This shows that our President is really flexible and tolerant towards addressing national issues. – Mhaka. ResponseS to “Mzembi faces extradition” The long arm of the law is catching up with criminals who surrounded former president Robert Mugabe. — Gakangoma. If it is proven that Walter Mzembi was never ill, would that find his lawyer Job Sikhala guilty of perjury, lying under oath? And what sanctions would he face from the lawyers’ association? — Masaisai. Response to “Mhofu doesn’t have a contract”. Mhofu should know that he also caused division during the Callisto Pasuwa era. As coach, he once influenced Omega Sibanda to fire Pasuwa. As if that was not enough Mhofu and Rahman who were both part of HPC found themselves in the new technical set up. I feel sorry for Pasuwa whose handler in the form of Mahachi never fought for him to have his dues. He was made to sign a contract believed to be a two year one but with a hidden clause for a single year. They turned their backs on him and started negotiating a contract for another successor. – Observer Response to “Govt opens up fuel imports”. This will help some of the big companies to go and purchase their own fuel for the efficient running of their businesses without disturbances. – Arnold Tinoda Mupfawi.
