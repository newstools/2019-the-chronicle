The Chronicle Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent A TEENAGE girl is lucky to be alive after she was left clutching her intestines when she was stabbed for turning down a neighbour’s love proposal. This was heard when Blessing Masukume of London Farm in Gweru appeared before Gweru regional magistrate Mrs Phathekile Msipa facing one count of attempted murder. Masukume (21) allegedly stabbed Ms Rebecca Ndlovu on the stomach leaving her intestines protruding after she turned down his love proposal. He was convicted on his own plea. For the State, Mr Kelvin Guvheya said Masukume got angry when his proposal was turned down. “On December 31 last year at around 3PM, Masukume went to Ms Ndlovu’s home to collect his memory card which he had lent her,” said Mr Guvheya. The court heard that Masukume proposed love to the complainant promising to give her the memory card for good. “Ms Ndlovu tried giving Masukume his memory card back but he refused saying Ms Ndlovu could keep it and in turn he proposed love to her,” said Guvheya. He said when Ms Ndlovu turned down the proposal, Masukume got angry and produced an okapi knife from his pocket and tried to stab her. “The complainant then fled to her mother’s bedroom with Masukume in hot pursuit. He stabbed her twice on the stomach leaving her intestines protruding before fleeing from the scene,” said Mr Guvheya. The court heard that Ndlovu was ferried to Maboleni Clinic where she was further transferred to Gweru Provincial Hospital where she was treated. The matter was reported to Maboleni Police Station leading to Masukume’s arrest recently after being on the run for three months. – @sukusinini
