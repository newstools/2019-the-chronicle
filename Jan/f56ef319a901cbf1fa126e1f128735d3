BULAWAYO dance group, Sungura Masters, has been invited to Burkina Faso for a cultural exchange visit courtesy of another cultural music and dance group from that country. The manager of the group, Socrates Siziba, who spoke highly of the young stars, confirmed the good news saying they were invited to Burkina Faso by Ambassadors Cultural Music and Dance Group to perform at one of their country’s Arts Festivals. Siziba, who indicated that he received the invite during his visit to Burkina Faso late last year, said the group is scheduled to travel to the West African country mid-February once the paperwork for the trip is finalised. He said Ambassadors Cultural Music and Dance Group realised that Zimbabwe has a rich cultural heritage and it is through music and dance that the culture can be conveyed. “This will be our first time to tour West Africa and we are very happy as a group. We’ll be in Burkina Faso courtesy of Ambassadors Cultural Music and Dance Group who were fascinated by our energetic dances,” said Siziba. The group once had a successful tour of South Africa courtesy of Killen Golide Tshuma and Bhekimpilo “Mr Breeze” Siziba where they held 32 shows and made a name for themselves. Siziba said the cultural exchange in Burkina Faso was going to help spread their craft outside the country and market Zimbabwe’s cultural dances. “It has always been our wish to get involved in cultural exchange programmes with groups outside the country and create synergies that will see us collaborating at some stage,” said Siziba.
