LUPANE State University (LSU) has introduced a degree in Kalanga and Community Studies as part of efforts to promote indigenous languages in the country. It is the first university in Zimbabwe to introduce Kalanga as a degree programme. Kalanga is recognised as an official language by the Zimbabwean Constitution and is taught in schools in some areas. It is widely spoken in Bulilima, Mangwe districts and other parts of Tsholotsho. In an interview, the university’s director of marketing and public relations Mr Zwelithini Dlamini said the programme was introduced in response to public demand. “The communities asked us to provide degrees in indigenous languages including Kalanga to complement our national constitution since it now recognises all the community languages that are spoken in the country,” said Mr Dlamini. He said the country’s school curriculum has seen the language being taught in some schools. Mr Dlamini said studying indigenous languages at a tertiary level enhances effective communication skills and also promotes African languages. “We are introducing this programme aiming to produce best communication skills within the country and the training will be for four years,” he said. Recently, the Zimbabwe Indigenous Languages Promotion Association (ZILPA) urged college students to take up Kalanga teaching courses. The organisation also said people should help produce books in indigenous languages. — @sharonbuwe
