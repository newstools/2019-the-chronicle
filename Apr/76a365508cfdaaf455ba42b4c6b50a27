The Chronicle Sports Reporter YOUTHS from Harare, Kwekwe and Zvishavane joined at least 500 young athletes from nine countries in celebrating the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace by playing 17 simultaneous football games on Saturday. The competitions were organised by Generations For Peace, a global non-profit peace building organisation based in Jordan. The global event emphasises the power of sport to foster unity and build peace across physical, mental, and emotional borders. The games kicked off at midday and played across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. In Zimbabwe, the games were held at OlympAfrica Centre in Harare, Midlands State University, and Kwekwe High School. Ephraim Katongo, an official from Generations For Peace, who oversaw the event in Harare, said: “Zimbabwe has for many years faced challenges when it comes to social cohesion and transforming violent conflict among youth. Get the Ball Rolling 2019 was a great opportunity to address those challenges and many others around the world, providing a safe space through sport where local youth could unite, crossing mental and emotional borders they face every day and recognising that they are not alone. This event, like all Generations For Peace programmes, highlighted the power of youth to lead us toward a more peaceful future, if we only provide them with the opportunities and empowerment they need to do so.”
