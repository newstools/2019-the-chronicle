Not all countries will listen to the US and UK, other countries are willing to conduct business with us. — @Dabu. Zimbabwe is now ripe and mature for investment and those who want to invest wisely, should come to Zimbabwe whether it is in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, industry and commerce or tourism. – @Gakangoma. Things will be better soon as you can see investors are coming to Zimbabwe as they can see internationally that our President is destined for greatness. -@Tinoda69.
