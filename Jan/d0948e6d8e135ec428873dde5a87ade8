NETHERLANDS senior business experts will meet captains of industry in Bulawayo on Friday as the city moves towards attracting investments. The city council recently announced a host of policies and incentives aimed at luring investment and restore Bulawayo as the country’s industrial hub. The upcoming business meeting was being organised by the Professionals Business Association of Zimbabwe (Probaz). In an interview last week, Probaz president Dr Lucky Mlilo said the Dutch business experts were coming under an organisation known as PUM Netherlands senior experts and they will be in Zimbabwe to educate and offer tips to all interested businesspeople free of charge. “On Friday Probaz will be hosting PUM Netherlands senior experts who will be educating business leaders who are interested in various issues that affect business at no charge,” he said. “The organisation has committed its works on assisting developing countries and through interactions one can be lucky enough to be linked with other businesspeople in Holland.” Dr Mlilo said some of the areas that will be covered by the presenters include sectors development, project support, agricultural financing and technological monitoring and evaluation. He said it was not only Bulawayo businesses that were being invited at the upcoming event but any interested business leader even outside the city. “So far, we have registered businesspeople keen to attend the event in Bulawayo from as far as Zvishavane,” he said. Probaz is a professional association that links different professions and also helps them with expert advice in their different fields of expertise. —@queentauruszw
