The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent ARTISTES have come out to mourn the late Black Umfolosi member Alec Ncube who died on Monday in Bulawayo, describing him as a humble, humourous man who loved his art. Ncube, who was part of the globetrotting group for over 25 years died at Mpilo Central hospital after succumbing to blood cancer. He was 52. Artistes such as Afro jazz muso Jeys Marabini who worked with Ncube when they were part of Imbube outfit Sunduza Boys has fond memories of their time working together. “He was always a jovial man, who cracked jokes to lighten any mood. I remember in the 90s when we were part of Sunduza I’d walk from Entumbane, pass by collecting Alec from New Lobengula to Pumula for rehearsals. I’m at a loss for words that he has died. In fact I’m saddened,” said Jeys. Another Imbube exponent, Men of Influence, through its spokesperson Mthandazo Nyoni said they were distraught. Sotsha Moyo, one of Black Umfolosi’s founding members said as a group they were devastated. He said Ncube, who sang alto, took his art seriously. “Ncube was with us through the hard and good times and stood by the art and our dream as Black Umfolosi.” Mourners are gathered at 57472 New Lobengula (opposite Njube High School turn). Burial arrangements will be announced in due course.
