The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter DEFENDING ZITF Four-Minute Mile champion, Wellington Varevi, fired warning shots ahead of today’s final, qualifying with the best time in the semi-finals held at White City Stadium yesterday. Varevi ran four minutes 13,93 seconds to book a place in the final of the Delta Beverages sponsored competition, which is likely to be a pulsating event today at 11am, at the ZITF Main Arena. Seasoned athletes who include Nyasha Mutsetse who had the second best semi-finals time of four minutes 14,14 seconds, ZRP Fairbridge’s Isaac Mpofu who posted four minutes 16,38 seconds, Black Rhinos trio of Trust Hove, Tendai Zimuto and Levison Mapfuwe made it into the final with ease. “I want to defend my title and I know that this is going to be a tight final because everyone who made it to tomorrow’s race gave a good show. “They probably reserved some energy for tomorrow’s final and I’ll have to up my game,” said Varevi. Varevi who is also the 2014 edition winner, last year led from the whistle and is likely to use the same strategy today. The winner of today’s race will get $800, with the first runner-up walking away with $400 while the third placed athlete is set to pocket $300.
