The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter DEFENDING champions Zimbabwe will get the defence of their Cosafa Cup with a quarter-final clash against the winner of Group A that has Angola, Eswatini, Comoros and Mauritius following a draw conducted in South Africa on Tuesday night. This year’s Cosafa Cup, initially meant to be hosted by Zimbabwe before it was turned to South Africa after Zimbabwe turned down the hosting offer, will be held in Durban from May 25 to June 8. Hosts South Africa will square up against rising nation Botswana while Zambia, losing finalists last year, will face the winner of the Group B pool games that has Mozambique, Namibia, Malawi and Seychelles. The other quarter-final tie sees Lesotho coming up against East African guest nation Uganda. Angola, like Zimbabwe, will be heading to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt shortly after the tournament and that would be a massive quarterfinal line-up were it to materialise. The four winning quarter-finals advance to the Cup semi-finals, while the losing teams will move in to the Plate competition. 2019 Cosafa Cup draw Group A Angola eSwatini Comoros Mauritius Group B Mozambique Namibia Malawi Seychelles Quarterfinals Zambia vs Winner Group B Lesotho vs Uganda Zimbabwe vs Winner Group A South Africa vs Botswana
