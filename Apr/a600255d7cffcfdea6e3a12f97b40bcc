The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma Gwanda residents had a fruitful long weekend as a series of events that were lined up for their entertainment all lived up to their billing. Starting from Independence Day on Thursday, fun lovers flocked to Gwanda District Club where an array of artistes including Bolamba and Jahunda arts groups gave splendid performances that saw people party until the wee hours of Friday. On Good Friday, Gwanda music promoters took the town’s entertainment scene to another level as the Block Party that was held in the CBD was well attended. As early as 5pm, revellers thronged the street bash that was held opposite The Nest Pub and Grill. A modelling contest was also held and Linda Ncube was crowned The Nest’s ambassador. Brilliant and Thandi Luphahla were crowned first princess and second princess respectively. The sound system at the block party was world class and it gave Gwanda Prison wardens a torrid time controlling inmates (who were a few metres away) who were heard singing along to the songs. DJ Nicksoul, Ra Angie, Virus, DJ Mzoe, Brandon and Ngobese among others left a mark on the decks as they blazed hit after hit. Gospel music lovers were not left out as a gospel festival to celebrate the death and rise of Jesus took place at Jahunda Community Hall over the weekend. Headlined by Vocal Ex, Hybrid Psalms, Zagoe and Minister Ngoni, the concert was oversubscribed as the hall was packed. – @mthabisi_mthire
