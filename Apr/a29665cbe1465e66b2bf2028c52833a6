The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter The Zimbabwean edition of Our Perfect Wedding (OPW) is set to begin on April 18 and will be broadcast on Zambezi Magic (DStv channel 162). Announcing that the Zambezi Magic channel had been moved to DStv channel 162 from 161, starting this month, the company also shared the OPW Zimbabwe dates. “The countdown to the highly anticipated season of Our Perfect Wedding Zimbabwe has officially begun. The show features engaged couples gearing up for their big day and will premiere on 18 April at 21:30,” said MultiChoice Zimbabwe in a statement. After having called for bids for a local production team, presenter and couples two months ago, DStv seems to be ready to roll out the show. On the show, viewers will have an opportunity to watch a behind the scenes of the couples weddings. The goal is for the couples to try and tick off every item on their wish list and hopefully, have their perfect wedding. They will be captured checking every item on their wish list and at the end of the show, declare if they had their perfect wedding. Liz Dziva, MultiChoice Zimbabwe publicity and public relations manager said the OPW Zimbabwe show was part of efforts to increase Zimbabwean content on the Zambezi Magic channel. “Our Perfect Wedding Zimbabwe is to be broadcast on DStv’s Zambezi Magic channel as part of the ongoing drive to increase the level of Zimbabwean content on this platform. “Zambezi Magic was created to do just this and this is an excellent platform for Zimbabweans to showcase their stories about their journeys to the altar.” South African and Zambian versions of Our Perfect Wedding have so far been warmly received by DStv audiences across Africa and it is hoped that the Zimbabwean version will be equally successful.
