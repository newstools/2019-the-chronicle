The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter GOLDEN Oldies Social Soccer League season gets underway at different venues in Bulawayo this Sunday with the pick of the weekend opener being Ambassadors’ home match against Amavevane. Ambassadors are in their second season in the league and is a team made up of football legends and former players who include Zenzo Moyo, Ronald Gidiza Sibanda, Johannes Ngodzo, Aubrey Saurombe, Agent Sawu, Herbert Dick, Fizo Siziba, Golding Dube, among other former greats. Amavevane, who gave the former stars a torrid time on their debut season last year, will be eager to inflict some early damage to Ambassadors, especially if all Amavevane players turn up for the party. Amavevane were, however, a pale shadow of themselves last season with the club losing to some whipping boys in the league, a situation which led to the club making some changes to their technical set up. Another interesting match will feature Zimbabwe Stars and Railstars while National University of Science and Technology plays host to Jerry Sibanda’s Mzilikazi Pirates. Resurgent Izinsizwa are away to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and Wolves take on Revolution. Fixtures All Stars v TelOne, Ambassadors v Amavevane, Blue Stars v Isigubhu, Maranatha v Mzilikazi United, RBZ v Izinsizwa, Soccer Sunday Hillside v Globe Trotters, Wolves v Revolution, Zimbabwe Stars v Railstars, Nust v Mzilikazi Pirates.
