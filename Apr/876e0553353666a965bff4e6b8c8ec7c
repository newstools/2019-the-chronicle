The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter AT least 150 participants have registered for the fifth edition of the Bulawayo Chess Association (BCA) Easter tournament to be held on Friday at Nust. Registration for the competition closed yesterday, but organisers said they were accepting late registrations for $8. Secondary school participants will be charged $5 and primary school learners will fork out $3. The winner of this tournament automatically qualifies for the year end Bulawayo Championship. Eshward Mudhumo, tournament’s chief organiser, said the event also provides a platform for junior chess development. “Everything is set for the tournament and as of today we’ve got over 150 participants that have registered. We’ve decided to keep registration open until Independence Day to allow those travelling or those that are yet to hear about the competition time to register,” said Mudhumo. Participants will contest in five categories; the Open, Ladies, Junior A (Form 4-6), Junior B (Form 1-3) and development (primary school). Castro Sibanda of Nust is the defending champion, but is expected to face a stern challenge from past winners, who include the tournament’s inaugural champion Ricky Malaba, Tapiwa Jele of Nkulumane, who won the second edition in 2015, and 2016 winner Sifiso Ncube of ZRP Bulawayo. – @ZililoR
