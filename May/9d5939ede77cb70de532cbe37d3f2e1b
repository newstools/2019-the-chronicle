The Chronicle Kudzai Chikiwa, Business Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) recorded the highest patronage of its rail leisure service in April 2019 since reintroduction of the steam excursions in 2010. Rail leisure is a product portfolio of the transport giant’s passenger services whose mandate is to provide a special tour experience through recreational and leisure activities for steam enthusiasts, tourists and adventure seeking travellers. Passengers pay for return tickets pegged at average RTGS $45 for adults and RTGS$25 for children. NRZ public relations manager Mr Nyasha Maravanyika said their first steam train ran from Harare to Kintyre near Lake Chivero and attracted 361 passengers. This included 221 adults and 140 children compared to last year’s 260 passengers. “NRZ recorded an increase of almost 100 passengers compared to last year. This is the highest patronage we have recorded so far since the reintroduction of steam excursions in 2010,” said Mr Maravanyika. He said the increase was a sign that Zimbabweans were appreciating the value of domestic tourism and leisure, which in the past was regarded as a preserve for the elite. “When we reintroduced steam excursions in 2010, we had very few people with whites being the majority. In the past it appeared it was not a priority to go for leisure and domestic tourism for blacks but we are happy that our people are now appreciating the value,” he said.—@tamary98
