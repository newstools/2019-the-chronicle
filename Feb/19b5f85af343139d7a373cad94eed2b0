Joint security checks by the Zimbabwe Republic Police and the Zimbabwe National Army are bearing fruit after a recently stolen police rifle was recovered on Wednesday night at one such check point along the Shurugwi-Zvishavane Road, police have said. Police in the Midlands province said the rifle, serial number 102, two pistols, a magazine charged with 20 live rounds and a pair of handcuffs were recovered stashed in the boot of a Nissan Almera at a police and army road block. “Two suspects, Adance Tongogara (44), who was driving the car and Israel Chikona (25) were immediately arrested and are detained at Shurugwi Police Station under RRB number 3636680,” police said. Another suspect whose identity was not immediately available yesterday, reportedly got out of their vehicle and escaped into the darkness as soon as he realised that their car was being searched. Police spokesperson for Midlands province, Inspector Joel Goko confirmed the incident but referred further questions to national police spokesperson, Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi who said he was locked in a meeting.
