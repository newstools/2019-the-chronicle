The Chronicle Twitter Responses to “Zifa turns down Cosafa Cup”
Good decision. You can’t make a budget for such an event with this economic situation. The Minister of Sports is very smart can’t withstand regional embarrassment. – @Zimbo. Sensible and that should have been the position from the beginning. We now need to prepare for Afcon 2019, get our boys in shape, their incentives etc. Develop junior football before we host tournaments that may not add value. – @Connmwanawashe. We can use the resources to prepare for Afcon 2019. – @Moronmofoto. Facebook Response to “SA reaffirms support for Zim”
Cde Editor, it’s very encouraging to hear a strong voice from the SA government against economic sanctions bedevilling our economy. This should send a strong message also to our local opposition political leaders, who support sanctions. The MDC-A leaders should stop and introspect about their political future, given that their politics is not accepted in Africa, but only in Western neo colonial circles. Zimbabweans who are suffering because of the satanic sanctions will never accept any MDC-A party to govern in Zimbabwe. Zimbabweans will, in the end, win against the Western and MDC-A evil violence brewing against our elected government. — Professor Mzvinavhu.
