The Chronicle Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent AN 87-YEAR-OLD woman has dragged a 60-year-old headman to court for allegedly raping her 40 years ago. At the time, Radios Nezvikonde allegedly compensated the woman (whose name is withheld to protect her identity) with two head of cattle. Nezvikonde allegedly raped the woman in 1979 when he was 20-years-old. Appearing before Zaka resident magistrate Ms Gladys Nago on Tuesday, Nezvikonde was not asked to plead to one count of rape. He was remanded in custody to today for trial at Chiredzi regional court. Prosecutor, Mr Innocent Mudzingwa said the elderly woman alleged she developed chronic leg pain, which has been giving her problems up to today, after the rape. She alleged Nezvikonde pinned her right leg down during the commission of the crime. The court heard that Nezvikonde admitted the charge of rape when he was brought before the then Chief Ndanga’s traditional court and was ordered to pay two beasts, as compensation, in 1979. Mr Mudzingwa said the elderly woman reported the matter to the police last week after realising that she had developed recurring pain on her leg which she related to the rape incident. The woman said: “Despite the compensation, I have a recurring pain on my right leg. I attribute it to the rape incident and it reminds me of the sexual abuse I suffered at the hands of that man”. Mr Mudzingwa said Nezvikonde, who was sworn in as a headman last week, was arrested following the woman’s police report. — @walterbmswazie2
