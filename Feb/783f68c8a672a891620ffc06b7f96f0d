Thousands of Zanu-PF supporters thronged Rutenga grounds in Mwenezi East, Masvingo on Saturday for President Mnangagwa’s “Meet the People Rally” much to the chagrin of the prophets of doom who had said it was going to be a flop. Masvingo provincial chairman who is also Masvingo Provincial Affairs Minister, Cde Ezra Chadzamira said President Mnangagwa’s visit will remain etched in many people’s minds as it proved wrong the prophets of doom and detractors. “Firstly as Masvingo, we are humbled by the turnout at President’s meet the people rally hosted by Mwenezi East and held against the backdrop of a lot of adversity from the country’s and party’s detractors,” said Cde Chadzamira. He said President Mnangagwa’s speech was pregnant with meaning while his message was incisive. “He tackled social and economic development issues with aplomb of a genius which left members without doubt that he is a leader who will take us to the promised land. He actually hit the nail on the head when he denounced violence,” said Cde Chadzamira. “We pride in his humility shown by the invitation of all political parties and leaders in religious, social and economic spheres to a dialogue. His hands are always outstretched to reach out to any Zimbabwean including the opposition.” In his speech during the rally which was also beamed live on national television, President Mnangagwa called on citizens to embrace peace and shun violence. He denounced violent protests instigated by the MDC-Alliance, Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and NGOs pushing for a regime change last month. The protests saw people’s shops being looted, roads barricaded and a policemen killed while dozens others were injured. President Mnangagwa hailed Masvingo province for refusing to participate in the violent protests. — @waltermswazie2
