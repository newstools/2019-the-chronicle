THE Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) has begun mapping enterprises involved in live animal trade in the region to establish basic data on regional and international markets. This is intended to enhance the livestock value chain by linking animal fatteners, feedlot operators, abattoirs and slaughter house operators to the regional and international markets. Comesa said a recent report prepared by its senior livestock officer, Dr Yoseph Mamo, has highlighted that the programme will enhance the traditional marketing channels of ad hoc sales to well-coordinated links among different enterprises. “Thus, this programme will work to improve the traditional marketing channels of ad hoc sales to well-coordinated links among different enterprises to reduce risks and improve gains. “Once the enterprises involved in the value chain of live animal marketing in the major exporting country is mapped, the market channel in the major importing countries will also be mapped,” he was quoted as saying. Mapping of enterprises involved in live animal trade is also one of the strategic objectives of the Comesa Livestock Policy Framework aimed at facilitating access to markets, services and value addition among different stakeholders who produce, and market livestock. – @okazunga.
