The Chronicle Eddie Chikamhi, Harare Bureau THE Zimbabwe women’s cricket team captain, Mary-Anne Musonda, says they have unfinished business with Uganda. The Lady Chevrons left for Kampala last night for a T20 Triangular series. Musonda and her team want to use the tournament as part of their preparations for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup Qualifier which they will host in Harare next month. But they have not forgotten thatUganda broke their hearts in 2017 when they beat the Lady Chevrons by three wickets in the Women’s World T20 Africa Qualifier to be crowned champions of the continent. Last year, Uganda also defeated Zimbabwe by seven runs in the final of the Women’s T20 Challenge in Harare. But, after spending eight weeks in camp, Musonda told our sister  paper The Herald yesterday her side were ready for battle. “We have been in camp for about eight weeks and there is so much excitement. There has been lots of intense fitness training. “In terms of fitness, I think we are quite there. In between, we have also played practice games and we have worked hard on our batting, bowling and fielding. This tour is crucial for us to put into practice everything that we have been working on,” said Musonda. The Lady Chevrons are expected to play at least four games in Uganda. They will get the ball rolling on Saturday against Kenya in a mid-morning clash.
