Coaches from Premiership and First Division clubs as well as scouts or player agents are free to attend the camp and identify talent. “Besides the players being taken through their paces, we’ve invited physical trainers, administrators, referees and dieticians to talk to the players. “We will also be giving tips on contract negotiations, contractual obligations, health and hygiene, expectations of referees and people from the media will talk to the players on the face of football from the media’s angle,” said Sweswe. The former Highlanders, Dynamos and Kaizer Chiefs defender said players contracted to clubs are welcome to attend the plenary sessions that will also tackle drug and alcohol abuse. There have been concerns that most footballers are succumbing to peer pressure and are abusing substances like ‘bronco’ (BronCleer, a cough syrup), Diazepam and other drugs. — @ZililoR
