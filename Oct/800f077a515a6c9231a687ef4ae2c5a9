The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe women’s Sevens national team are ready for the Africa Women’s Sevens tournament which kicks off in Tunisia tomorrow. The tournament is a continental championship for women’s Rugby Sevens in Africa. The Lady Cheetahs as they are commonly known will square off against some of Africa’s finest talents in Group B that has South Africa, Zambia and Uganda. “The preparations have gone on well. I think the ladies are ready to play and we promise to do our best,” said Lady Cheetahs coach Derek Chiwara. The team will be led by Precious Marange as she is the most experienced player out of the lot and is confident that she will lead the team to a good outing in Tunisia.
