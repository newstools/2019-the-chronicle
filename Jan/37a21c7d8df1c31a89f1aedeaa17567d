A 30-YEAR-OLD man has appeared in court for allegedly assaulting his wife after she delayed bringing him water saying she wanted to bath first. Definite Mpofu of Village 6 Macdonald in Umguza, who is unemployed pleaded guilty to a physical abuse charge when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Adelaide Mbeure. The magistrate sentenced him to 105 hours of community service. Ms Thandiwe Mlotshwa reported Mpofu to the police after she was assaulted. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said on Monday last week Ms Mlotshwa was sent to bring water by her husband and she decided to bath first. Mpofu then assaulted his wife and made her pack her clothes saying he was sending her back to “the elders” to be taught to respect him. “Allegations are that on January 7 this year at around 2PM Mlotshwa and Mpofu had a misunderstanding on why Mlotshwa refused to fetch him water on time,” said Mr Mageza. The court heard Mlotshwa told him that she would first bath herself and the children then bring the water her husband had asked for. “After Mpofu heard what his wife said, he instructed her to call her sister so she may come get her. Immediately he told Ms Mlotshwa to pack her bags and proceed to her elders’ house so she may be taught how to respect him,” said the prosecutor. The court heard that Mpofu owed his wife $45 and she requested it saying she wanted to use it for transport. Mpofu told her that he didn’t have the money and they had a misunderstanding which led the accused person to assault his wife with a stick on her back, the court heard. She sustained bruises on her back and reported the matter to the police leading to Mpofu’s arrest. — @gwizi_n
