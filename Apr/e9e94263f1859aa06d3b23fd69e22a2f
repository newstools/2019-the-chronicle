The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls THE National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz) in Matabeleland North has challenged all schools in the province to establish athletics clubs as part of the sport’s grassroots development. This follows a dismal performance by Matabeleland provinces at last week’s combined National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) and National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) track and field athletics competition held at Midlands Christian College in Gweru. Matabeleland North finished bottom of the medals table with one gold, two silvers and two bronze, while Bulawayo settled for ninth position with two gold, six silver and two bronze medals, and Matabeleland South finished eighth with three gold, five silver and four bronze medals to cap a poor run by the region. Harare province emerged overall winners with 15 gold medals, 11 silver and nine bronze medals. Naaz Matabeleland North athletics coach Tawanda Mutero told Chronicle Sport that all schools in the province had been directed to form athletics clubs. “This is non-competitive event, but we can tap talent and nurture it. After last week we realised we need to continue training throughout the year, hence the need to establish school clubs from primary to secondary school level,” said Mutero. He said the clubs should be in full swing before this year’s National Youth Games.
