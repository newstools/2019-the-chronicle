The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent KWAITO rapper, Mawiza, who has been nominated for the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAAs) says he is honoured to be named among Bulawayo’s best. The Chipo Tsodzo hit-maker has been nominated in the Outstanding Kwaito/House/Gqom Artiste category alongside DJ Skaiva and Novuyo Seagirl. Mawiza (real name Wisdom Moyo), who last month released a track titled Alpha and Omega, said the nomination has boosted his confidence as an artiste. “I’m honoured to be nominated among Bulawayo’s finest artistes. The nomination has boosted my confidence and given me the courage to work on an album,” said Mawiza. The Entumbane-born artiste whose Chipo Tsodzo track was a hit as it topped charts on most local radio stations, said the album will be out at the end of July this year. Mawiza said he is confident of scooping the award. “The competition looks stiff as Skaiva and Seagirl are amazing artistes but Iam confident I will beat them. “I had amazing projects last year that have certainly made the right noise in the right places,” he said. The Nust Finance student said this year he wants to hold many shows around the city with or without the help of promoters. “I’m hoping to build a fan base at Nust so I’m meeting the Students’ Representative Council as I’m planning to hold monthly shows at the university.
