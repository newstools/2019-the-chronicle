From the moment I arrived in India they treated my husband and me well. I have no complaints but praise. Whoever wants to be treated in India I recommend Kiran Hospital. Above all else I want to give praise to God. He has been good to me all the time. He stood by me throughout this ordeal. Now all I want to do is go home and eat isitshwala,” said Ms Muchegwa. Cde Modi, who is also the Bulawayo South legislator, said he was happy that Ms Muchegwa was recovering well after the operation and gruelling physiotherapy sessions she was put through at Kiran Hospital. “When I first saw her injuries I thought the chances of her making it were very slim but I said to myself we should try to save her life. I am one of the happiest people in Zimbabwe right now, I am happy to see her walk. I want to thank everyone who chipped in to help her because without your support we could not be celebrating her walking today. I also want to applaud the church and its pastor (Prophet Itai Ukama) for standing by her. Seeing people cheering and shedding tears of joy shows that we still have decent people in Zimbabwe,” said the renowned philanthropist. <img class="wp-image-456472 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-07-at-08.42.03-680x376.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="376" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-07-at-08.42.03.jpeg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/WhatsApp-Image-2019-07-07-at-08.42.03-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> “I am happy to see her walk.
