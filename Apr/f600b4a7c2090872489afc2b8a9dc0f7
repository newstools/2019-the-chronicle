The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter THIS past Sunday, the Bulawayo arts and culture community came together to bid farewell to Voti Thebe, the director of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo. An appreciation show for Thebe who resigned in February was organised by the Bulawayo Cultural Affairs Office and Nhimbe Trust at the National Art Gallery. Many arts figures including Raisedon Baya, Josh Nyapimbi, Nkululeko Nkala and Babongile Sikhonjwa came through to say their goodbyes. Nobuntu, Khaya Arts, Project Ngoma, Desire Ncube, Thamsanqa, Sthae the Poet and Lady Tshawe provided entertainment. During the proceedings, Thebe was handed a certificate of appreciation, a knobkerrie and traditional headband to appreciate his role in the arts and culture of Bulawayo. Thebe had been the regional director of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo for over four decades, making him the longest serving staff member of the gallery. In his farewell speech, Thebe said: “Leaving this position doesn’t mean that I’m also leaving the arts industry. <img class="size-medium wp-image-443187" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/voti-thebe-1-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/voti-thebe-1-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/voti-thebe-1-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/voti-thebe-1-680x529.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/voti-thebe-1.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Voti Thebe I’ll always be part of the arts industry and my doors are still open for those who need advice. I appreciate the love that you have all shown me.” The longest serving artiste at the gallery, Dumisani Ndlovu, said they would miss Thebe as an administrator. “I’ve been working at the gallery since 1993 and I’ve worked with Thebe for a very long time. He was a man who had a kind heart and he’ll be sorely missed as an administrator. “However, what’s good is that he’s joining us full time (as an artist) and we welcome him,” said Ndlovu who is a visual artiste. Nyapimbi of Nhimbe Trust also appreciated Voti Thebe’s impact on Bulawayo’s arts industry. “Mr Thebe played a very crucial role in the arts industry. He was a mentor to many artists and he’ll always have an impact in this region’s arts and culture as he is a father figure.” Musician and arts administrator Nkululeko Nkala weighed in saying: “Voti Thebe is a very important figure in the arts industry of Zimbabwe as a whole. He’s someone who’s always willing to share knowledge and advice and I wish him all the best for the future.” Thebe, a recipient of the President’s Award of Honour for his contribution to Visual Art in Zimbabwe, trained at the Mzilikazi Art and Craft Centre in Bulawayo. Over the years, he exhibited various works including metal sculpture and print works. He joined the Gallery in 1975 and participated in numerous exhibitions since 1978. He travelled to study office management, management of the arts and Museum studies in Canada. An integral member of the arts scene in the City of Kings, he has been tireless in his promotion of fellow artists and in raising the profile of contemporary Zimbabwean art. Having been awarded the President’s Award of Honour in 1997, Thebe in 2003 won the Outstanding Achievement in the Visual Arts Best Service Award from Nama. Clifford Zulu, who was a curator at the art gallery, took over from Thebe on March 1 as regional director of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.
