The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
INDEPENDENT content producers in Binga are appealing for financial assistance to shoot a drama film whose aim is to depict life in rural Binga. There is no broadcast transmission in Binga and as such people are not enjoying local radio and television services. Digital Moments Creative Arts which has worked on three productions, one of them sponsored by ZimDigital last year, wants to turn the corner and empower the district. Their director, Kalulu Mumpande, who also chairs the Binga content creation committee, said they are working on a fourth drama film titled Malweza but are handicapped by lack of funding. “People want to produce films but are handicapped by economic challenges. We have done a production called Malweza with 13 episodes but the challenge is funding for transport and food for the cast and crew,” said Mumpande. He said the total production cost is $33 700 but they are more concerned about the $2 530 for food and $2 240 for transport for the cast and crew. “We want to run it (production) at a low cost and all that we want now is money for food and transport. We have hired equipment and our plan is that crew and cast can be paid after we sell our product,” he said. Mumpande who said they are motivated by the need to tell the Binga story and also empower youths through arts, said they intend to shoot in April if they get the funding. He paid gratitude to the ZimDigital programme for empowering youths through training. ZimDigital has trained scores of content producers countrywide and many have since submitted proposals for drama and documentaries and those approved will receive funding for shooting. – @ncubeleon
