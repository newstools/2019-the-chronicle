The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE presence of foreign players in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League had been on the decline in the past seasons, but 2019 has seen a number of clubs importing talent in their quest to win the league title. Highlanders imported Zambian Peter Nyirenda and Dynamos brought in Ngandu Mangala from the DR Congo. Nyirenda, a former ZECO United striker, became an instant darling of the Bosso fans with his mazy runs against Black Rhinos in their first league encounter. Dynamos’ Mangala scored a brace in a 2-0 win against league debutants Mushowani Stars. DeMbare also have three other imports, Robert Sackey, Herve Vincent Mbega and Ngahan Claude Junior. Bulawayo Chiefs have Francis Atsu from Ghana, while Ngezi Platinum have Monday Osi Minuri, a Nigerian signed from Talen Vision. The league is evolving and getting bigger and teams have been signing attacking players. The PSL may not be the most watched and followed league in Africa, but it seems most foreign players see it as a perfect platform to move to the lucrative Absa Premiership in South Africa.
