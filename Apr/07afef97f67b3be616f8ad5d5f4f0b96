The Chronicle Ellina Mhlanga, Sports Reporter NATIONAL youth and juniors athletics coach, Briad Nhubu, is happy with the progress made by most of the athletes earmarked for the Under-18 and Under-20 African Championships this month. The competition will take place from April 16 to 20 in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire. Nhubu said while they are still to finalising the team, there are positive signs from the shortlisted athlete. Most of them took advantage of the Nash and Naph competition held last week in Gweru to fine-tune their preparations. “We were just monitoring them. The competition, it was really tough, very competitive and all the athletes on the list have shown high performances. “Most of them are quite in shape and we would want to believe they will continue working hard for the championships. “We believe they are ready to go and compete,” said Nhubu. Athletes such as Vimbai Maisvoreva, Masciline Watama, Privilege Chikara, Donovan Mutariswa and Simbarashe Maketa are some of the shortlisted athletes. They have represented the country in major events before, including the World Under-18 Championships, African Youth Games as well as the Youth Olympic Games. “The majority of them, we have worked with them before, this time they are now Under-18s and Under-20s. “So, in terms of continuity, I can say there is a lot of continuity, we are making references to previous performances before we consider them to be part of the contingent for such a big event. “Of course, we talk of experience and I know we have quite good experienced athletes. But, I also have good knowledge of other athletes from other countries such as Nigeria, Botswana and South Africa. “This age-group is the same that was at the African Youth Games and the Youth Olympic Games in Argentina,’’ said Nhubu.
