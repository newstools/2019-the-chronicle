The Chronicle Harare Bureau Bread supplies are set to improve in the coming days following the arrival of 19 000 tonnes of wheat which was bonded in Beira. The wheat was released after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe paid US$7 million last week. The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) said the development will increase flour availability, and consequently bread supplies on the market. GMAZ public relations manager Mr Garikai Chaunza said the wheat will cover national flour requirements in the meantime. “GMAZ is pleased to announce that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe last week released US$7 million for the payment of 19 000 tonnes of wheat which was bonded in Beira,” he said. “The wheat has since arrived and distribution to millers started over last weekend. The consignment is expected to cover the national flour requirements for one month as more resources are being mobilised to procure more (wheat). “With the arrival of this wheat consignment, bread supplies are set to be improving throughout the country in the coming days.” There are shortages of bread on the market, resulting in bakers supplying the parallel market at higher prices. Average bread prices are now $6 on the parallel market, up from the usual $3,40. Mr Chaunza said another consignment of 60 000 tonnes of wheat still holed up in Mozambique as payment is being negotiated with the RBZ. He bemoaned electricity outages being experienced in the country, saying they will affect the milling of wheat, if not contained. Mr Chaunza said GMAZ will continue with the price monitoring exercise to ensure retailers sell grain products at agreed prices. “We will continue with the price monitoring programme to check whether or not retailers are in compliance with the stipulated prices on our products, chief among them mealie-meal, rice, flour, and salt,” he said. He said GMAZ will not hesitate to cut supplies to unscrupulous retailers found overcharging basic commodities.
