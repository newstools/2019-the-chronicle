Innocent Ncube, one of the tournament’s organisers, said the event was a success and showed them that sports gatherings are effective in promoting socialisation. “The tournament was a befitting event for the long holiday which saw a number of football supporters coming to watch. “We invited teams from two districts, Matobo and Mangwe, and they both provided two teams each,” said Ncube. “The event was even nicer because of the presence of our brothers and sisters based in the diaspora that had come home for the holiday. “We want to make it a point that the participating teams give young local players a chance to demonstrate their talent. “The initiative seeks to groom local talent and instil among them the spirit of togetherness,” he said. — @DecoDecent2
