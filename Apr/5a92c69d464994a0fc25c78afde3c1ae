The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma PHILIPPINES-based A cappella group – Oasis Music – is set to release their debut single titled Thina Sofananaye this Saturday. The outfit is made up of seven former Solusi, Maranatha, Nyazura and Anderson Adventist school students who are now studying at the Adventist University of the Philippines. Its members are Rumbidzai Mamunze, Mandlenkosi Ndlovu, Nomagugu Sibanda, Mthandazo Mlilo, Gugulethu Bafana-Ncube, Bhekumuzi Gumede and Nicola Ncube. Speaking from the Philippines, the group’s communications officer Bhekumuzi Gumede said: “We’ve been performing across the Philippines at Adventist university graduation ceremonies where our performances have been well embraced. “We’re now working on incorporating the culture of our country in our music and are glad to be releasing our first official single.” Gumede said they had also recorded a video for Thina Sofananaye which will also be released on Saturday. “The song’s video which captures different cultures was shot and directed by the East Zimbabwe Conference media. It will also be uploaded on various social platforms on Saturday.” After the launch of the single, the group will embark on a nationwide tour of the Philippines and are also planning to make their debut performance in Zimbabwe later this year. Through the new single, Oasis Music hope doors will open for them so that they grow their solo music careers. – @mthabisi_mthire
