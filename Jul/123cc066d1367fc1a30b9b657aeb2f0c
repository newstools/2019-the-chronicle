THE Godlwayo South Soccer League (GSSL) has received a timely boost ahead of the start of the second half of the season after sponsors of the tournament increased their sponsorship package. Bhekimpilo Maranda Sithole, the GSSL board chairman, said it has been a difficult race to the halfway mark for the league with some teams not being able to fulfill their matches due to lack of transport. Sithole, a Bulawayo-based businessman, sponsors the GSSL together with the South African-based duo of Kossam Mavuna Ndlovu and Zibusiso Majankwe Ncube, who call themselves MMM. “Away teams have been struggling to go for games, so we are going to be providing fuel so that every team fulfills fixtures. This year the sponsors MMM have increased the prize money and this gives the league more competition. We are still finalising with other stakeholders before announcing the new figures. The increase in sponsorship was meant to bring competitiveness to the league,” Sithole said. GSSL chairman Armiot Sibanda thanked MMM for their continued support. “They are doing a great job in terms of improving our league. The issue of transport has been a major worry and we are grateful for the fuel gesture. Having sponsors chipping in will help improve our league. We would also want to have our referees going through training so that we are as professional as we can be,” he said. The league consists of 14 teams and is in its fifth edition this year. — @innocentskizoe
