HIGHLANDERS FC supporters group Our Pride has donated 23 pairs of socks and committed to provide groceries to cater for players during the team’s pre-season camp that starts next week. Benjamin Ndhlovu, the group’s secretary, said it’s the fans’ obligation to assist the club since Bosso is owned by the community. He said they would be supporting the club’s junior set up more this year since head coach Madinda Ndlovu believes in youngsters and will be monitoring them throughout. “We used to sponsor the player of the month prize, but realised that our coach believes the team needs to be built from the juniors to promote stability. “To motivate players, we had to come up with something for the juniors, thus we donated a kit for the Under-16s late last year and we saw it fit to donate socks that can be used by the juniors or the senior team,” said Ndhlovu. He said plans are afoot to support the #FillUpBF initiative. “We also appreciate other groupings that have done road shows as a marketing strategy and we’re suggesting that as different supporters groups, we organise a road show before our first match of the 2019 season and appeal to the fans to desist from hooliganism.” Highlanders’ chairman Kenneth Mhlophe reported that the club was supposed to get $15 000 for being losing quarter-finalists in the Chibuku Super Cup, but after fines they got just $5 000. For finishing fifth in the PSL, the prize money was $40 000, but they only banked $22 000, with the bulk going to fines caused by some unrepentant fans. So instead of them getting a total of $55 000, they got $27 000. “As a group we feel like it is our responsibility to protect the interests of our club and we believe the technical staff will bring back our glory days. “Apart from bringing in members to join us, we’ll also ensure that fans are aware of the importance of coming to the stadium and rallying behind Highlanders,” Ndhlovu said. — @DecoDecent2
