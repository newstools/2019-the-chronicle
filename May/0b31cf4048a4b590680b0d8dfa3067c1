The Chronicle Editor — The Patron, Chairman, and Trustees of the John Landa Nkomo Memorial Trust would like to join the Dabengwa and Khumalo families and the nation at large in mourning the passing of this giant gallant fighter of the liberation of Zimbabwe. The history of the liberation struggle will not be complete without mentioning the name of Dr Dumiso Dabengwa affectionately known as DD. He was a fighter par excellence and was an icon of the liberation struggle.  A man whose achievements are well documented and yet he was humble. The Trust is aware of Dr Dabengwa’s liberation and post independence camaraderie and close friendship with the late Dr John Landa Nkomo. The Trust is therefore grieving the loss of a friend of the late Vice President of Zimbabwe, and the rest of the Nkomo family.  He was a simple man and easy to approach.  We pray and hope that Mrs Zodwa Dabengwa and family find strength in the knowledge that the John Landa Nkomo family feels their sad loss. Hamba Kahle Qhawe lama Qhawe. May Your Soul Rest in Peace Board Chairman Jabu Nkomo and all the Board Members
