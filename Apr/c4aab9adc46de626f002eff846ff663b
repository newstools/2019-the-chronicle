The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS’ new 2019 kit is in the process of being properly branded and the Bulawayo giants will for now be using their 2018 One fusion kit which they received towards the end of last season. Reacting to concerns from fans and supporters over the ‘new’ kit that was used at the sponsorship unveiling ceremony last Friday which some fans described as ugly, Bosso’s chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube said that was not the kit they will be using this year. “Our new kit is coming,” said Dube while addressing the media at the club offices yesterday. He said just like last year, the kit that will be used for the first few games will be downgraded to a training kit once they take delivery of the proper kit. “The process of branding comes in after the sponsorship is locked down. The processes of kit creation and branding are afoot as we speak. The kits will be coming and until we get the strip for this year coming through, we will be using our One fusion kit. We have a new One fusion kit which we received last year which we didn’t use so we are not short of kit”. The Highlanders head of secretariat said their 2019 kit will be branded NetOne, instead of the One Fusion that the club was using last year but the brand will still be Roar. “What is important to note is that this year we will not be carrying One Fusion but we will be carrying NetOne so the new kits that are coming will be branded NetOne, designs have been done and agreed to so like we did last year you will see the downgrading of the One Fusion kit to the new one,” said Dube.
