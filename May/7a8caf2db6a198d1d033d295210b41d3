The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter ABOUT 1 000 women aged between 30 and 65 will receive free cervical cancer treatment through a joint programme between a Chinese and a Zimbabwean hospital. The Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital of China and Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals have started looking for beneficiaries. Cervical cancer is the most prevalent and deadliest form of cancer in Zimbabwe and statistics from the Ministry of Health and  Child Care show that it kills about four women daily. In a statement, the Ministry of Health and Child Care said all women from across Zimbabwe were invited to go to Parirenyatwa and register between today and May 19. “Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in partnership with Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Hospital from the People’s Republic of China are inviting up to 1 000 women aged between 30 and 65 for free early cervical cancer screening and treatment,” read a joint press release from the two medical institutions. According to the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Related Cancers in Zimbabwe report, all women who are 15 years and above are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Risk factors include early age of sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, HIV infection, Sexually Transmitted Infections and smoking. Estimates indicate that every year 2 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 1 451 die from the disease. Lack of information and access to screening and treatment services contributes to the high mortality rate especially in rural areas. — @thamamoe
