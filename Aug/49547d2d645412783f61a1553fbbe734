The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER referee and Zifa executive committee member Bryton Malandule left for Kigali, Rwanda, on Saturday for a week-long Fifa funded Futuro 111 referees’ instructors’ course that will also be attended by participants from 23 other African countries. The course kicked off yesterday. “Basically it’s training for instructors to train referees. I am doing level one, Sabelo Maphosa and Brighton Mudzamiri will do the advanced level next week. “We also have Makonese Masakadza and Khanyile Dhlamini who will attend the advanced physical instructors’ course next week. All these are Fifa funded courses to develop referees in member associations,” said Malandule. Wellington Mazambani from Mashonaland West will also be doing a beginners course in physical fitness. “The courses for referee instructors use a regional format, assembling and educating instructors from neighboring countries at a centralised venue. “These candidates have been selected and approved by Caf and Fifa. The course for referee instructors (Futuro 111) in Rwanda will focus on the education of referee technical instructors and referee fitness instructors from member association of your region. The instructors are expected to be actively involved in the development of refereeing both before and after the course,” reads the invitation letter from Fifa. Malandule said locally Zifa had lined up three Fifa courses from September 7-10 for an elite referees course, elite instructors course (September 12-16) and a youth referees course (September 26-30) in Bulawayo. “We will have Fifa instructors conducting all these courses. All this is to improve our refereeing standards and our participants will be drawn from all provinces and will also include women,” said Malandule.
