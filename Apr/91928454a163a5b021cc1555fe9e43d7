The Chronicle Sports Reporter FC LUPOPO forward Roderick Mutuma, who is in top form at his club, is eyeing a national team call-up. The self-proclaimed prince of football joined the DR Congo side at the beginning of the year and has scored seven goals in eight games. The former Dynamos, Caps United and Highlanders player’s dream comes at a time when the Warriors are set to participate at the Cosafa and Afcon tournaments respectively. “I believe everyone wants to play for the Warriors because it’s a blessing to play for the national team. “In the near future I hope to get a Warriors call up,” Mutuma told our sister paper Hmetro. Last season, he played for the now defunct Nichrut where he struggled with injuries. The 30-year-old forward says working hard has helped him to rediscover form. “You know it’s not easy considering where I have come from, but I credit it to working hard and a few coaches who had faith in me. “Callisto Pasuwa always encourages me to keep my head up and this has helped me in every decision that I have made in life. “Also not forgetting my former coach John Nyikadzino who helped to bring the best out of me though at times I would doubt myself. “The move to join the Shurugwi-based side made me realise what was important in my life,” said Mutuma. He joined the Congolese side in December last year, his second stint beyond our borders, having played for Bloemfontein Celtic in South Africa.
