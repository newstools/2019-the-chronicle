The Chronicle Walter Mswazie, Masvingo Correspondent The Masvingo Music and Arts Awards held at the Charles Austin Theatre recently, lived up to their billing with the city’s artistes being urged to continue excelling. Among the winners were musicians Gary Mapanzure, Melmery and Brendon Mvura as well as poet Ngoni Paradza, actors Khetani Banda and Bridget Mukova. Producer, Charles Mungansa, was also awarded for his Operation Restore Regasi film. Harare-based Masvingo artiste, King Shady who was the guest artiste was recognised for being one of the consistent artistes and was presented with the Best Performance Award. The awards ceremony also saw journalists George Maponga of our sister paper, The Herald and Golden Maunganidze from Great Zimbabwe Campus Radio walking away with awards for best partners. Awards’ organiser, Phineas Masekesa said he was happy that everything went according to plan and thanked the Masvingo community for embracing the event which was in its third year. He said the winning artistes should not relax as their next target should be to penetrate the national scene and eventually spread their wings outside the country’s borders. He also thanked sponsors; Econet Wireless, N Richards, Masvingo Caravan Park, Talent Chivange, Delta Beverages, Makurira Memorial Clinic and Lulu Designs among others for their support which saw the artistes walking away with prizes. “The event was very successful and we realised that it’s fast becoming popular among the Masvingo community as we had a huge crowd. I can safely say this year’s event was bigger and better than the previous two editions and we hope that it continues growing,” said Masekesa.
