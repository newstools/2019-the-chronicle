THE Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) will this week take some decisive action on the problems bedevilling the sport of netball in the country over clashes between the Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) and Rainbow Amateur Netball League. Despite being instructed by the SRC to amend its constitution and accommodate the Glow Petroleum sponsored Rainbow Amateur Netball League, Zina has persistently refused to recognise and register the Melody Garikai chaired breakaway league and in the process been accused of sabotaging the country’s maiden appearance at the netball World Cup finals set for Liverpool in England in three months time. This comes after Zina secretary general Babra Rice wrote threatening letters to principals of the clubs participating in the Ranl league that Zina will not call up players from Ranl into the national team. The threats were also supported by the long serving Zina president Letticia Chipandu. “The media actually alerted us to this unfortunate standoff and like I said I am going through the papers here in office to see what exactly led to that and I am sure by Wednesday we will issue a definitive and informed position on that,” said the SRC director general Prince Mupazviriho. Despite the threats by Zina, players and officials from Ranl have remained defiant with Ranl’s secretary general Moses Gukurume intimating that they will be consulting their legal team over threats and accusations by the Zina leadership. “The only problem we now have is that the secretary general of Zina Barbra Rice has written to uniformed teams mentioning that we are furthering the interest of the opposition party and we will consult with our lawyers to see how those allegations can be redressed. We are urging our constituency to remain calm and respectful of Zina as the problem is not the institution but individuals,” said the secretary general.
