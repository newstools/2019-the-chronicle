He called on mine operators to ensure that the work environment was safe for their employees. “We continue to record fatal accidents in mining areas as a result of mechanical faults. We call on mine operators, mine owners and managers to ensure that their equipment is constantly inspected and serviced to ensure that it’s working properly so that workers are not exposed to danger. “Mine workers should also ensure that safety is prioritised. It’s also important for mine workers to put on safety clothing,” Chief Insp Ndebele said. — @DubeMatutu.
