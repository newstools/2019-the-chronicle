FORMER Zimbabwe Under-19 captain Dumisani Mankunzini has attained Cricket South Africa’s (CSA) Level Two Umpires’ Certificate, going a step towards officiating first class matches. The 28-year-old former leg spinner whose promising career was cut short by a back injury in 2013, moved to South Africa in 2017 and is happy with his feat. “It took me two years to complete the CSA Level Two Umpires’ course.It means I can now umpire 1st class matches which is one step below international cricket and I am now umpiring premier league. “The course covered on the new ICC rules, cricket laws, calculating over rate,rain stops,run rate,players penalty and obviously decision making. I’m really excited and my wish is to go further and get an international umpires’ certificate. I believe with God and hard work, nothing is impossible,” said Mankunzini. The former Tuskers player has also been doing television and radio commentary as well as match analysis in South Africa. “I’m enjoying myself here in South Africa. I have been doing more of TV and radio commentary and match analysis for Pakistan Cricket TV,Cricingif and radio for Guerilla Cricket SA. One of my major games that I did analysis on was the South Africa versus Pakistan Test game played at Newlands where I worked on the sidelines with veterans like Mpumelelo Mbangwa, Makhaya Ntini, former South Africa captain Shaun Pollock and former English cricketer Kevin Peterson,” said Mankunzini. There are videos showing Mankunzini, an ex-Milton High School pupil doing commentary in South Africa. “I’ve also managed to get sponsorship from HS SA who are providing me with umpiring boots and golf shirts for commentary. They are also providing me with coaching equipment because I’m also training kids in Gauteng Province,” Mankunzini said.
