MAVERICKS maintained their hold at the top of the Bulawayo Basketball League table after beating Oilers 75-64 at Khanyisile Sports Centre on Sunday. The leaders put up a spirited performance against middle-placed Oilers to consolidate their position, as Highlanders B continue to breathe heavily on their neck after hammering Clippers 107-37. Mavericks look set to dislodge defending champions Giants, who did not fulfil their fixture against Nust last Friday and were walked over. Giants are, however, appealing the decision. Mavericks player Andile Chirindah said his team will continue working hard as a collective up to the last match of the season. “We’ll work as a team knowing that we’ve got to avoid complacency and we’re going to take every game seriously. “We want to finish in the best possible position,” said Chirindah. He said Giants’ can’t be ruled out of the title despite forfeiting the game against Nust, as they have a good squad to turn things around. “There’s no small team in the title race and we play every match with that in mind. “Despite their depth, we will have to deal with everything they bring at us, meaning we have to win all our remaining matches,” he said. Highlanders A suffered a setback after being condemned to a 61-58 defeat by Nust A. There was also a women’s All Star game on Saturday which was used to select the Bulawayo Provincial team to play at the provincial games to be held in Masvingo at the end of this month. Team Gera led by Lakers’ Geraldine Chibonda beat Team Nobu captained by Mavericks player Nobukhosi Ndlovu 48-35.
