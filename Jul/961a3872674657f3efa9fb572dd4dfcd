The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter AS the race for Premier Soccer League (PSL) promotion rages on, Bulawayo City are on the road to Hwange to face Makomo in a Southern Region Division One League encounter tomorrow. The former Premiership side is hoping to register victory following two consecutive goalless draws against Bosso 90 and CIWU. City enjoy a two-point lead over second-placed Talen Vision, who are away to Arenel Movers at Crescent this afternoon. The municipal team has 29 points from 13 games and will be hoping to add to that tally with a win on the road. “The boys are fired up and the morale in camp is very high. We have not had good results in the past two games, but we are not reading much into that, we are focused on the job at hand. It will not be an easy game, we play against a strong team, but our goal is to go there and collect maximum points,” said City coach Try Ncube. City have three injury concerns, as Benson Phiri, Thabo Lunga and Crispen Ncube have all been ruled out of tomorrow’s encounter. City and Talen Vision remain the only undefeated sides in the league after 13 games. Both sides have, however, struggled with consistency, which has allowed the chasing pack to remain within striking distance. CIWU, who are fresh from an impressive goalless draw with City, are in third place on the league table with 22 points from 13 games, just six points behind the log leaders. Ciwu are, however, inactive this weekend.
