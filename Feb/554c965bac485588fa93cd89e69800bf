FRESH from thrilling fans in Bulawayo, Zimdancehall-man-of-the-moment, Enzo Ishall, will be coming down south again for a debut performance in Gweru on Friday. Dubbed the “Shoe Game Party”, the Smart Inotangira Kutsoka hit-maker will be at Club Excite where he will officially launch the club’s VIP section. He is expected to share the stage with Gweru’s Zimdancehall chanters Legion and Xiddo. On the decks will be host DJ Crocx and DJs Oxygen, Nelz and Petwares. A day after the Gweru show, Enzo will travel to Zvishavane where another show has been lined up for him at Club Vatican. Here, the 50 Magate challenge which he is famed for from his 50 Magate track will be in full swing as the show is mainly targeting MSU students there. Dubbed the “Official College Opening Gig”, Enzo will share the Zvishavane stage with Seunononga hit-maker Guspy Warrior and rump shaking 50 Magate video vixen Kikky BadA$$. MSU media students and hip-hop sensations Zimboy and Munya Unruly will also perform with DJs Touch and Jachaon taking care of business on the decks. Now known for pulling crowds wherever he goes, the Kanjiva hit-maker is expected to pack both venues as has been the case with his Bulawayo shows at The Vista and Cosmopolitan Night Club. Show organiser Terminator Makoni said all was set for the much anticipated shows. “After the success of the Bulawayo show, we’ll be taking the Magate fun to Gweru and Zvishavane this weekend. Plenty of free tickets will be given to females who participate in the 50 Magate dance challenge through sending short video clips to Enzo Ishall’s Facebook page,” Makoni said. – @mthabisi_mthire.
