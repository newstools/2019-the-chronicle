The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter CHIEF Felix Nhlanhlayamangwe Ndiweni who was serving 18 months imprisonment following his conviction with his 23 subjects for destroying a villager’s property in Ntabazinduna, was today released by the High Court on $500 bail. Ndiweni (54) and 23 other villagers were recently convicted by Bulawayo magistrate, Ms Gladmore Mushove for malicious damage to property belonging to Mr Fetti Mbele’s property.
