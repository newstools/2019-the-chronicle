Veteran Chimurenga musician Thomas “Mukanya” Mapfumo yesterday mourned the death of international icon Oliver Mtukudzi saying he never knew that last year’s performance together would be their last. Tuku died at the age of 66 at Avenues Clinic in Harare on Wednesday afternoon after battling diabetes for a long time. Mukanya was briefly in the same band as Tuku, the Wagon Wheels, in the 1970s and gifted him one of his biggest hits: Rova Ngoma Mutavara. During the Homecoming Bira staged by Mukanya at the Glamis Arena in Harare last year, Tuku also took to the stage, bringing together two Zimbabwean music greats on the night.  <img class="wp-image-434294 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Berita-and-Tuku-582x680.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="680" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Berita-and-Tuku-582x680.jpg 582w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Berita-and-Tuku-308x360.jpg 308w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Berita-and-Tuku.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /> Berita and Tuku The Lion of Zimbabwe as Mukanya is also known who arrived in the country yesterday, said the night was brilliant and would be forever etched in his memory. “I will say that last year in 2018 when we joined hands on the stage at the Glamis Arena, little did we realize that we were doing our parting shots. Kwaive kuonekana (It was a farewell). It was a night well spent with our fans as we sang and danced to celebrate a surprise twist of events in Zimbabwe. The rest of the history would unfold as we kept in touch and made efforts to strengthen our music and give hope to the people of Zimbabwe,” said Mukanya in a statement on his Facebook page. The United States of America-based Mukanya hails from the same rural area in Guruve with the late Tuku. Mukanya described the late Tuku as a brother and friend, a kind hearted man who was proud of his culture. <img class="wp-image-434297 size-large" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Judith-Sephuma-with-Tuku-680x369.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="369" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Judith-Sephuma-with-Tuku.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Judith-Sephuma-with-Tuku-360x195.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Judith Sephuma with Tuku South African soapie Isidingo announced the death of Mtukudzi during the last scene of Wednesday’s episode. Jah Prayzah said Samanyanga as Tuku is also known has songs that touched the hearts of many. “I’ll never forget your love Samanyanga and your songs Mhukahuru. All the good days will remain in people of Zimbabwe’s minds and they will never forget about you. People would fill up your shows and most of them would get emotional to the extent of crying because of your songs which didn’t discriminate anyone. As your son I say go well, till we meet again,” posted Jah Prayzah. Songstress Ammara Brown said Tuku had been part of her life ever since she featured on the Olivine Cooking Oil advert when she was nine. <img class=" wp-image-434300" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Ruvheneko-and-Tuku-360x287.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="542" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Ruvheneko-and-Tuku-360x287.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Ruvheneko-and-Tuku.jpg 678w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ruvheneko and Tuku Calling the late music icon Uncle Tuku, she shared that he was there for her during the happy and sad times of her life especially when he spoke compassionately at her father Andy Brown’s funeral. “Honestly I would cry even harder if I had to list all the beauty you poured into this world and into my life. The amount of music and wisdom you shared with us all is one of the greatest treasures Zimbabwe has and will ever know. Thank you for sharing your greatness. The honour was ours, so you will always be a legend in the pages of our history. You will always live forever.” Winky D who featured Tuku in the blockbuster hit Panorwadza Moyo said he was privileged to learn from him. “He never allowed his tongue to turn bitter in a musical interaction. We can’t forget how he danced with vigour and spirit to every drum throb. He was a true champion, father, friend and musical guardian. Conversation with him always sweetened pure water. Most importantly he taught us to disregard minor setbacks in the path towards greatness.” DJ Stavo said: “It’s a very Dark time for Zimbabwe. My heart is heavy. My Hero, Legend Oliver Mtukudzi has passed. Africa and indeed the world have lost a great music icon, a legend whose music touched millions of people across the world. RIP Mdhara Tuku.” <img class=" wp-image-434323" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/The-late-Oliver-Mtukudzi-and-DJ-Stavo-360x219.jpg" alt="" width="662" height="403" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/The-late-Oliver-Mtukudzi-and-DJ-Stavo-360x219.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/The-late-Oliver-Mtukudzi-and-DJ-Stavo.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px" /> The late Tuku and DJ Stavo The Arthur Evans Show producer Trevor “Trey” Ncube wrote: “RIP to a legend and icon a truly humble man who touched and inspired many across the continent with his songs, was an honour having him on #thearthurcevansshow #RIPTuku and a special shout to Saimon Mambazo Phiri for making it happen.” Great Limpopo Cultural Trade Fair co-ordinator Hebert Phikela said the art industry was poorer without the voice of Mtukudzi and the province of Masvingo would forever cherish his music. “Tuku was the soul of the music industry in Zimbabwe and beyond,” said Phikela. “As people from Chiredzi who are predominately of Vatsonga /Tshangani dialect, we feel robbed . Tuku and Dr Thomas Chauke of South Africa who is also of Vatsonga origin had been discussing for a possible collaboration. This was going to make us happy as Vatsonga people and as Zimbabwe to have our own coming together with a South African artiste. We say on behalf of Great Limpopo Cultural Fair and the Vatsonga people we say etlela hi ku rhula nhenha ya vuqambi (you deserve hero status).” South African rapper Cassper Nyovest shared a video of him singing along to Tuku’s Bvuma, while driving in South Africa. <img class=" wp-image-434299" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Tuku-with-DJ-Fresh-270x360.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="693" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Tuku-with-DJ-Fresh-270x360.jpg 270w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Tuku-with-DJ-Fresh-510x680.jpg 510w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Tuku-with-DJ-Fresh.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /> Tuku with DJ Fresh DJ Fresh shared a picture he took with Tuku sometime last year when he interviewed him in South Africa. “A year ago, the world lost Icon Bra #HughMasekela. The very next day Bra #OliverMtukudzi joined us for some #FreshBreakfast. He spoke so fondly of Bra Hugh and the memories they created together. Exactly a year later and they are together again. #RipOliverMtukudzi #RIPTuku.”
Soul Brothers said of Tuku: “He provided shade and food to everyone. When the world wars broke out, he stood tall and raised his voice to rebuke all kinds of brutalities that innocent people had to suffer. Tuku was an unshaking mountain that faced storms.” Internationally acclaimed reggae music group Morgan Heritage posted on their twitter page: “We were privileged to share the stage with the great Tuku & have the honour of meeting him in person. He was a giant of a musician and so humble at the same time. We pray the legacy of this great musician lives on forever. Our prayers go out to the family of Oliver Mtukudzi #RIP.”
