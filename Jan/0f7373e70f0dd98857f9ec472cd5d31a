EROTIC dancer Beverly Sibanda is doing well in South Africa but is coming back to Zimbabwe for a series of shows. Bev had relocated to South Africa and been virtually forgotten, until some weeks ago when Zimdancehall’s man of the moment Enzo Ishall’s song 50 Magate went viral. Soon a 50 Magate challenge ensued with many videos of gyrating women being poured water on their buttocks mimicking clay pots used by prophets to exorcise them of their raunchy dance demon, as purported by the song, emerged. In typical Bev fashion, she stole the limelight when she entered the frenzy when she did her own version of the dance in a two minute video. Bouyed by the popularity of the song and Bev’s dance moves, her video also went viral, further reminding people that she was indeed the queen of the dance floor. Her manager Hapaguti “Harpaz” Mapimhidze said Bev was always fully booked in South Africa. “Bev is doing well in South Africa as she is booked on every weekend. Clubs and nightspots are looking for her services left, right and centre and this is very good for her career as she can make ends meet,” said Harpaz. He said Bev was popular because of the sheer number of Zimbabweans in South Africa. “Bev performs for mostly Zimbabweans. There are so many Zimbabweans in South Africa and most of them have never seen Bev perform live. “They only know her on WhatsApp videos that they share. So when she relocated she gave them a chance to watch her live,” said Harpaz. He said this week Bev would be in the country to perform in Harare before she travels back to Mzansi for a showdown with her nemesis Zoey on February 3 in Pretoria. “There are some shows that Bev will hold in Zimbabwe as the country still loves her. Thereafter she’ll travel to South Africa to perform with Zoey,” said Harpaz.
