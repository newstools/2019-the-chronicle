The Chronicle David Price believes he has the advantage over Dereck Chisora ahead of their heavyweight fight tonight — after using hypnosis on his opponent during the weigh-in. The pair faced off for a final time ahead of their bout at the O2, with Chisora weighing in at 18st 8lbs 3oz, while Price was 4lbs heavier at 18st 12lbs 4oz. Chisora eventually arrived to the event with his trademark Union Jack bandana and dark sunglasses before the bout, which is on the Regis Prograis-Josh Taylor bill. ‘No chance of that happening,’ Price told Sky Sports. ‘I’m just nice and calm and relaxed really. ‘I’ve just said to him then, even though I couldn’t see [through] his sunglasses, I’ve looked into his eyes, I can hypnotise him. I have been taking lessons on how to hypnotise. ‘Told him he’s going to be as weak as a kitten tomorrow. He said ‘it’s the only chance you’ll have’, but you know what, I’m looking forward to it. This is what it’s all about, testing myself against top, top heavyweights and this is going to be a great fight.’ — dailyonline.
