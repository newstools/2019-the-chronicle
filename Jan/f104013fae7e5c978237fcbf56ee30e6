HOUSE music lovers in Bulawayo will this week be in for a treat as Zarah Lounge will host the first sessions on Friday with a launch of DJ MduSevan’s album Broken Boundaries. The launch was supposed to take place two weeks ago at the same venue, but had to be postponed because of the violent looting that took place in the city. The 12 track album has songs such as Love at First Sight, Children of the Soil, Ingozi and Electronic Blues. The event will be held weekly. Organiser of the event Zarah Lounge Resident Albert “DJ Da Grooveman” Hlabo said the house music series came about after the realisation that there were so many talented artistes in the genre. “There are so many house music producers and singers that are very talented from the city. However, the problem is that their music isn’t getting the rotation that is needed for them to get them into the limelight. So with that in mind, I came up with this concept,” said Da Grooveman. He said the platform was to build the already existing house music lovers’ culture. “People love house music. With this concept we want to show them that there are actually great musicians and producers from the city, that can make them dance with their music,” said Da Grooveman. He said this week the platform will host seasoned producer MduSevan. “The album is good and we want to take advantage of the Friday sundowners, where people want to chill and relax winding down a busy week to soothing house music,” said Da Grooveman. He said his hope was for the platform to grow to a bigger event. “This is why we are doing this weekly, so that we have consistency and people get used to house music on a Friday. “Next week we shall have someone else on the stage. They’ll showcase their talent on the decks and mic. We hope this will build into a movement and a bigger event,” said Da Grooveman.
