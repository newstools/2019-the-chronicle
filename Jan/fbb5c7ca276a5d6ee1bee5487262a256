THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) requires $10 million to refurbish at least 50 coaches for its commuter services in Harare and Bulawayo. NRZ public relations manager Mr Nyasha Maravanyika told Business Chronicle that the main challenge was that the railways company has been using old coaches that have been in use since the 1960s. “These are now in a very poor state and require a major overhaul. The NRZ was only able to come up with seven coaches and later recovered another six coaches which have been deployed on the City-Cowdray Park commuter train. “The NRZ needs at least 50 coaches to cover the three Harare routes and the two routes for Bulawayo,” he said. The NRZ which requires about $10 million to refurbish the required coaches, has since re-launched the City-Cowdray Park commuter train service in Bulawayo and plans to operate the five routes in the two cities once resources are availed. Mr Maravanyika said NRZ has since submitted its refurbishment budget to Government and was awaiting response.
