The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma PREPARATIONS for Banomoya hit-maker Prince Kaybee’s show in Bulawayo are at an advanced stage. Event organisers, Cosmopolitan night club, said they have decided to stage the show outdoors as they are anticipating a huge turnout next Tuesday. The club’s manager, Manu Mahaso, said: “Prince Kaybee will perform outdoors as we want to increase capacity and ventilation. Security measures have been put in place so patrons should expect a well organised event.” Warming up the decks for Prince Kaybee, who is riding high with the Fetch Your Life hit, will be the club’s resident DJs Mzoe, Keazy and Kead Wikead. This will be Kaybee’s second show in the city after his debut appearance at the same venue.
