After his Bulawayo show, DJ Tira will take his tour back to South Africa on Saturday where he will team up with TipCee for a performance in Bethal. DJ Tira is the second high profile South African entertainer Cosmopolitan has hosted after DJ Prince Kaybee who was here last month. Ndlovu said as Cosmopolitan, they wanted to be known as the best of the best nightspots in the country. “Cosmopolitan Night Club has always prided itself with being a premium brand anchored on providing unique entertainment experiences for our clients and that means bringing the very best entertainers across the continent,” he said.
