The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma BULAWAYO gospel group Vocal Ex is billed to perform at the Gwanda Easter Gospel Festival taking place at the Jahunda Community Hall this weekend. The three-day event, which kicks off today, is being hosted by Destiny Life Ministries Church with Gwanda’s Hybrid Psalms also billed to perform. It will run under the theme “Blood Remember Me”. Siza Mdlongwa will lead the Vocal Ex pack with feature performances from up-and-coming gospel musician Zagoe and Minister Ngoni. Mdlongwa said fans should come in their numbers to experience a well-crafted performance. “Easter has come and we’ll be celebrating the death and resurrection of Jesus in style. Gospel lovers should come in their numbers as it’s a show not to be missed. “Lives will be changed through music and the word of God,” Mdlongwa said. Hybrid Psalms, which have made their name as curtain raisers at the Gwanda International Gospel Music Festival, are set to liven up the event with their new singles. – @mthabisi_mthire.
