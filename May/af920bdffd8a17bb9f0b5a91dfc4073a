The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Reporter HUNDREDS of people from all walks of life yesterday converged at Lobengula Hall in Bulawayo to bid farewell to the late national hero Cde Velaphi Misheck Ncube. Cde Ncube (82), who was also Zanu-PF’s National Consultative Assembly (NCA) member, succumbed to diabetes on April 29. In an emotional send off, speakers spoke well of Cde Ncube, describing him as a humble, honest and dedicated revolutionary who contributed immensely to the country’s liberation struggle. Addressing mourners, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Cde Judith Ncube described the late national hero as a true cadre who fought a good fight and left a rich legacy for the country. “In mourning Cde Velaphi Ncube as Bulawayo province and Zimbabwe as a whole, we are saying there is need to follow in his footsteps as he was a hard worker. We can only honour and preserve his legacy by working hard to grow our economy and improve the people’s lives,” she said. Cde Ncube said if Zimbabweans change their attitudes, the country will be a better place to live in. “I remember the late Vice-President Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo in his own words saying ‘Mr (Robert) Mugabe if we are not careful we are leading towards a chaotic situation. We need to rectify this issue of corruption before it is too late because if we don’t our children will destroy this country’s economy.’ Let us therefore put our heads together, unite and work for our country,” said Cde Ncube. <img class="size-medium wp-image-448810" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-11-360x293.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="293" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-11-360x293.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-11-768x624.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-11-680x553.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Untitled-11.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Body of the late national hero Cde Misheck Ncube being flown to Harare from Joshua Nkomo International Airport in Bulawayo   Zanu-PF Politburo member Cde Absolom Sikhosana said Cde Ncube was a revolutionary icon with an illustrious liberation history. “Cde Ncube was a true hero whose credentials are unquestionable.
