They followed the animal tracks which led them to a plot in Kezi,” he said. ‘‘The workers found the three accused persons together with Mbekezeli Nyathi and Zibonele Ndlovu who are still at large in the possession of four of the missing cattle. Upon realising that they had been caught, the accused persons and their accomplices fled from the scene leaving behind their clothes, an axe, brand mark iron bar and a pot full of meat.’’ Mr Shoko said a police report was made and four of the nine cattle were recovered.  He said on May 30, the police together with Mr Hunt’s workers went to the plot where they had recovered the stolen cattle and the workers positively identified Mncedisi Sibanda and Mgcini Ndlovu as part of the group of five men that was found in possession of the stolen cattle leading to their arrest. – @DubeMatutu
