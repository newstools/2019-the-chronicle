The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Selmor Mtukudzi will be driving Tuku’s legacy in style with a new set of wheels, a Range Rover Vogue which has been presented to her by Impala Car Rental. The car hire company which presented her with the sleek Range Rover, a few weeks ago gave her a Mazda Demio. The generous gift which is branded in her name has endorsed her as the late Oliver Mtukudzi’s heir apparent. Sharing the news on social media, Selmor said: “Thank you doesn’t seem to be enough anymore. Ndibatsireiwo hama dzangu, ndoti kudii pakadai?” After seeing images of the new car, comments poured in, most of them being congratulatory messages. Music promoter Barbara Chikosi said: “Impala, Mr Dondo thank you so much. Words alone cannot express how much to thank you for the honour to Selmor. “God bless you always. Selmor, keep going girl and be strong.” Businesswoman Nomathemba Ndebele also weighed in saying: “Stay strong girl . . . your father’s legacy should live on.” Award-winning gospel musician Mai Patai also thanked Impala Car Rental for their gesture.
