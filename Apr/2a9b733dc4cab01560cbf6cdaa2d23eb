The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter ONLY three teams, defending champions FC Platinum, Chicken Inn and returnees Hwange, have managed to collect maximum points after two Castle Lager Premier Soccer League rounds of matches. Chicken Inn sit at the top due to a superior goal difference and what is becoming clear is that well-funded teams have settled well. Chicken Inn edged Yadah 2-0 in Harare, with new signing Clive Augusto, who grabbed a brace in the season’s opener when they beat ZPC Kariba 3-1, on target against Yadah. Augusto now has three goals to his account. Another new signing Marlvin Gaki got the second Chicken Inn goal. Joey Antipas, the Chicken Inn coach, reckons his charges have no room for complacency and should quickly shift focus to their next game. “This is a marathon and as such, consistency is key. There’s no room for complacency,” said Antipas. The Gamecocks are showing signs of intent and their quick start to the season matches that of FC Platinum, who beat championship dark horses Triangle United 2-1. For the second week, former TP Mazembe winger Ali Sadiki got the opener for FC Platinum, with Lameck Nhamo getting the winner against his former paymasters. Triangle’s consolation goal came from Ralph Kawondera. Hwange stunned Dynamos 2-1 in the capital to keep up with the title contenders. Hwange showed character as they came from a goal down to silence the Harare giants in a match that the coalminers’ goalkeeper Taimon Mvula reportedly made top drawer saves. It was a good result for Hwange on the road. Premiership debutantes TelOne FC and Manica Diamonds were impressive, as they collected maximum points, with the former leaving it late to beat Bulawayo Chiefs 1-0 in Bulawayo through a strike by former Highlanders’ winger Tafadzwa Sibanda. Luke Masomere’s Manica Diamonds recovered from their 2-0 season opener loss to Caps United to hammer Harare City 3-1 at their adopted home ground Gibbo Stadium. Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Erol Akbay heaved a huge sigh of relief after his charges piled woes on new boys Mushowani Stars with a 2-1 win at Baobab Stadium. Mushowani seem to be finding the Premiership race tight and are already fighting against relegation. Mushowani join the trio of Harare City, Yadah and Bulawayo Chiefs as the only sides without a point from two games. The blockbuster clash between Highlanders and Caps United ended 0-0 at Barbourfields Stadium, with both sides playing some good football. Bosso striker Prince Dube hit the upright twice, while Caps United, who had an effort ruled out for offside, went home feeling hard done as they felt they were denied an opportunity to get maximum points.
