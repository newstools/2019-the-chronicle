The Chronicle Sukoluhle Ndlovu, Midlands Correspondent THE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) Midlands Chapter says it will hold elections for the new leadership in Gweru tomorrow. In an interview, outgoing CZI Midlands Chamber president, Mr Mike Dzinoreva said the chapter will elect a new president and his two deputies. “We have a 15-member executive committee that will participate in the elections,” he said. Mr Dzinoreva said the elections were supposed to be held three weeks ago but had to be postponed because a number of executive committee members had other commitments. Mr Dzinoreva said he was satisfied with the work done by the chamber during his time in office. “It has been a good year and I am satisfied with the work I did together with my team. “It was an eye opening term and we are happy because we managed to establish meaningful relationships with a number of Government departments. “We are happy to leave office having made significant contributions towards the running and resuscitation of industries in Zimbabwe,” he said. Recently CZI Midlands Chapter held its annual general meeting where executive committee members were elected. —@sukusinini.
