The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter NEARLY $10 million worth of property was destroyed by fire in Bulawayo between January and October this year, according to a council report. The city recorded 419 fire incidents over the 10-month period with January’s violent protests and power cuts hugely contributing to the high number of properties destroyed by fire. In its monthly Fire and Ambulance report released early this month, the council said property valued at nearly $10 million was destroyed by fire between January and October this year. During the illegal violent protests organised by the opposition party MDC- Alliance and its allies a number of shops in the city’s western suburbs were burnt and looted. Property valued at about $3 billion was at risk of being destroyed by fires as a result of the violent protests. The report blamed discarded lit materials and arson for most of the fire incidents.-@nqotshili.
