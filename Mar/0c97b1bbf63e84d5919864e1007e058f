The Chronicle Response to “Bond notes a success — Mangudya”. That was a good show and it also helped us understand a number of grey areas and a bit of insight into RBZ operations. It was quite refreshing to hear the Governor put Tendai Biti in his right place. Biti’s understanding of economics is questionable. This was both informative and very educative about the work of the RBZ. – Eliah. Response to “GMAZ to mobilise $80m for wheat contract farming”. The nation cannot continue losing more foreign currency importing wheat. This is a good development towards wheat farming and cutting down on imports. — Dalu. Response to “Ex-president bankrolls Chamisa, again”. The ex-president has got so much money to the extent of bankrolling his former rivals. What a shame. I must believe that the old man is no longer in his senses. Zanu-PF must treat him as a traitor and I don’t think this man deserves to be accorded a hero status when he dies. He suffering from a loss of memory. Dining with the enemy is not forgivable. – John Manjoro
