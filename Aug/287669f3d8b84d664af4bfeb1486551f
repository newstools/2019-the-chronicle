The Chronicle Editor — On August 3, 2019, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (Zec) held one National Assembly and two local authority (Ward) by-elections. All three by-elections were necessitated by the death of former Zanu-PF office holders who won the seats in the 2018 harmonised elections. ZESN deployed long term observers to all Wards in Lupane East constituency to observe from the pre-through to the post-election period. On election day, ZESN deployed observers to all 62 polling stations in Lupane East, all 14 Ward Collation Centres, at the Constituency Collation Centre, and had two mobile teams moving around the constituency.  Three observers were deployed to selected polling stations in each of the Wards where by-elections were held, Bubi and Nkayi. ZESN observers reported on a peaceful political environment in the run up to the election and on the election day. Political parties campaign activities went on unhindered and were most visible in Lupane with the MDC Alliance and Zanu-PF being the most notable. On election day, all election day procedures relating to election administration were carried out in line with the law. The three elections were won by Zanu-PF. The party retained the seats.
