Gweru commuter omnibus operators have complied with the new fares announced by the Government last week. The new fares between $1 and $2 were put into effect yesterday morning bringing relief to passengers. The Government last Thursday announced that commuter omnibuses should charge fares ranging from $1 to $3 depending on the distance. For a trip less than 10km commuter omnibuses are expected to charge $1, $2 for 11 to 20km and $3 for a distance from 21 km and above. A snap survey by this publication, showed that commuter omnibus operators in Senga, Southdowns, and Mtapa were charging $1.50 Previously, commuter omnibus operators had hiked fares without any justification. In Senga, commuter omnibus operators were charging $2, while Mtapa charged $1.50, Southdowns charged $1.50 and Mkoba charges were ranging from $2.50 to $3. The exorbitant fares left scores of people stranded, while some walked to their various work places. In an interview, a commuter who identified herself as Mai Chiedza and resides in Senga said she is grateful to the Government for restoring sanity in the transport sector. “At least the prices have been put on a reasonable scale; it was really expensive for us to pay a total of $4 to and from town. I also have children who need to commute to school every day, and it was really becoming a heavy burden for me”, she said. Tatenda Moyo, a driver plying Southdowns and South view route, said the new fares by the Government are reasonable because they can still make a profit. “The new fares are not bad at all because we can at least realise profits. We are also hoping that our profits will increase as President Emmerson Mnangagwa promised to grant tax rebates to the transport sector to make it possible for us to continue providing services with the same old price,” he said.
