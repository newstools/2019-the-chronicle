The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THREE unknown men pepper-sprayed a man from Bulawayo before robbing him of a cellphone and $40. Mr James Maboche from Sizinda suburb was robbed while walking home from work at about 11PM on Sunday in Belmont Industrial site. Bulawayo acting police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube yesterday confirmed the incident. “We are investigating a plain robbery case where a 37-year-old man was robbed of his cellphone and $40. The incident occurred on Sunday night while the victim was walking home. When he was about 500 metres from Colbro Company he met three men and two of them grabbed him and started to search him. When he fought back the third suspect attacked him with a pepper spray on his face. The suspects got away with his cellphone and $40,” said Insp Ncube. Insp Ncube said Mr Maboche screamed for help and when other members of the public came to rescue him the suspects had already escaped. “We want to appeal to members of the public who might have information that could lead to the arrest of the three suspects to come forward. We also appeal to members of the public to desist from using bushy paths no matter how convenient they might seem. This robbery could have been avoided if he had opted for a safer route,” he said. A pepper spray has severe effects including temporary blindness of about 15 to 20 minutes while leaving a skin burning sensation that lasts between 40 minutes to an hour, online reports reveal. Ironically, it is usually used as a defence mechanism from robbers. – @nqotshili
