GWANDA Tennis Club on Monday held a tennis workshop aimed at talent identification and reviving the game in the town. Gwanda Tennis Club coach Mtshutshisi Mathema said they had invited a number of coaches to the launch of the 2019 initiative. “We’ve come up with the project of reviving tennis in Gwanda with the assistance of parents. We’re still lacking a few things, but we’re in a position to get going and we’ll continue training the kids while seeking sponsorships. “We’ve been getting support from various stakeholders and we want to ensure that we never look back after all efforts we’ve made,” said Mathema. In early January, the community held a two-day coaching session at Gwanda High School conducted by Emakhandeni Tennis Club chairman Witness Jiyane and attended by 40 kids from two academies. “Tennis is a sport which has been getting limited support, especially in smaller towns, so the least we can do is provide a platform for those who believe they can make it to the top. We will monitor the participating kids and make them realise the importance of being professional all the time. “The club will work tirelessly with parents and the schools with the hope of ensuring that in the next three years tennis will be one of the most appreciated sports in town and surrounding areas,” he said. Lately, young players from Gwanda have been participating in competitive games organised by Emakhandeni Tennis Club in Bulawayo. Mathema said the club seeks to assist the youngsters break through and overcome economic challenges that hinder them from exploring their talents.
