THE MINISTRY of Transport and Infrastructural Development is set to resume constructing the road linking Mberengwa and West Nicholson and another one linking Mberengwa and Mataga after sourcing more equipment. The Mberengwa-West Nicholson Road, which will be tarred, will be the shortest route linking Gweru and Beitbridge as travellers will no longer need to pass through Bulawayo. If completed, haulage trucks and buses going to Zambia are likely to use that route as it reduces distance by close to 100km. Mberengwa-Mataga Road will also be tarred. Road construction equipment has already been moved to the site and construction is set to resume soon. Mberengwa North Member of Parliament Cde Tafanana Zhou said work on the road will resume soon after Government sourced equipment from a Gweru-based construction company Sheasham. Sheasham, which is owned by Mr Clever Mandaza, is one of the leading construction companies in the Midlands Province. “We are happy that construction of the roads in Mberengwa will soon resume. “The contractor is already on the ground and we are informed that Government sourced new equipment for the project,” said Cde Zhou. The MP once appealed to Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Engineer Joel Biggie Matiza for Government to resume the project after the contractor allegedly pulled out and removed equipment from the site owing to cash flow challenges. Cde Zhou once asked the minister in Parliament why there are delays in implementing the project. He said he was happy that Government had brought new equipment to the site and the project will resume soon.
