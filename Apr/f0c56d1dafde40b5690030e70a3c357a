The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter A mixture of soothing music marinated with engaging poetry is what people should expect from Lady Tshawe’s upcoming EP (Extended Play) titled In Therapy that will be released today. Once released, the EP which contains tracks Break Me, Story of Ex’s, I am Love, I Need Him and Love This Feeling will be available on the Urban Culxure website for download.

After a listening session held last week, Lady Tshawe said: “With this EP, people should expect great music and a different Lady Tshawe because I took a risk on this EP. It’s very experimental as I played around with various genres like Hip Hop, Jazz, Reggae and poetry.” Produced by Oktopus, a Bulawayo producer, the EM has one collaboration with afro-jazz musician Ex Mile. Explaining the In Therapy title, Lady Tshawe said: “Music is a therapy so when I was in the process of recording this project, I felt like I was on therapy so I wanted people to feel the same way while listening to it.”
