The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls TOURISM industry pace-setter, Wild Horizons, has started refurbishing the iconic Lookout Café which was reduced to ashes on Christmas Eve. Property worth thousands of dollars was lost when the gorge facing eatery, whose existence is synonymous with tourism because of its sumptuous meals in the resort town, caught fire. The cafe, which is now being reconstructed, was initially set to be re-opened next month but Wild Horizons management has said the facility will come back to life in September. Operators and individuals can’t wait any longer for the re-opening of their favourite eatery which is a destination highlight for Victoria Falls. Posting on its Facebook page, Wild Horizons management said the cafe will re-open on September 1. “When flames engulfed and devastated Wild Horizons Lookout Cafe, it was a searing loss for the town of Victoria Falls. While we have been working tirelessly on the reconstruction of this iconic restaurant, due to circumstances beyond our control, the process has encountered numerous hindrances along the way. “For this reason, we have regrettably had to postpone the opening date to 1 September 2019,” read the statement. The restaurant is popular among tourists as it overlooks the gorge and boasts of an eco-friendly environment coupled with surrounding thick forests and wildlife view. It also gives a view of the Victoria Falls Bridge while one enjoys a meal. The cafe used to employ more than 40 workers with a section of clients drawn from those who do high wire activities such as gorge swing, gorge view, zip line and flying fox. — @ncubeleon.
