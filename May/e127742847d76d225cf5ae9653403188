The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter SUPPORTERS group Bosso Tshilamoya donated deep cold sprays for the treatment of players to Highlanders at the club’s offices. A deep freeze cold spray delivers an instant burst of cooling pain relief and helps relieve painful sprains, strains, muscle pain and pain associated with arthritis and backache. It also promotes cooling therapy for muscles and joints. The sprays were presented to Highlanders’ chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube by Bosso Tshilamoya representative Fisnoliah Nolie Dube. The group pledged to donate deep sprays every three months and they have been doing that for a year. Nolie Dube, who is also a committee member of the social media group, said it’s their love for the club that pushes them to contribute. “Our wish is to go beyond donating such items and introduce a man-of-the-match award in the near future and we hope that through the WhatsApp group forums, we will have a supporters’ player of the year award where fans will vote for their best performing player of the season,” said Nolie Dube. She rallied other supporters to assist wherever they can to help ease the club’s financial  burden. “This is simply to demonstrate our love for the team. Our group has seen an enormous growth as people now appreciate our solidarity gesture,” she said. — @DecoDecent2
