The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent One of Bulawayo’s top female wheel spinner, DJ Liz recently gave birth to her first child. DJ Liz announced the good news on social media this week. She kept the whole pregnancy under wraps as she made rare public appearances during the year. Posting on her social media pages on Christmas Day, DJ Liz who mostly played at Hartsfield TshisaNyama, said 2019 ended on a blessed note. “2019 has been an amazing year. God blessed me with a beautiful angel. A precious gift. A mini DJ Liz, Taliah Owami Nandi,” she posted. In a follow-up interview, DJ Liz revealed the baby girl was born on November 27 at the Royal Women’s Clinic in Bulawayo. She said she was enjoying being a mother. “Motherhood is great. I’m enjoying every moment of it. Babies are a blessing and it’s a different phase in my life which has made my life more interesting. I spent my festive season indoors bonding with my baby, I guess I needed it – that little break,” said a content DJ Liz. Asked whether this meant she was retiring, she said just like DJ Zinhle, a mother of one from South Africa (who she looks up to), she would continue her career. “DJ Zinhle has Kairo but she’s still rocking. After all these years of building my brand, I cannot let it die like that. Obviously, I’m going to select gigs so that I have enough time for my child,” said DJ Liz. DJ Liz, real name Sharmaine Lizzie Waldman, has performed at big gigs such as Black Motion at Hartsfield TshisaNyama, Kalawa Homecoming at Queens Sports Grounds, Castle Lite Block Parties in Bulawayo and Harare and the Golden Pilsener gig in Bulawayo where she shared the stage with South Africa’s Busi and DJ Zinhle and local chanter, Winky D. When South Africa’s Babes Wodumo had a gig some two years ago in Bulawayo and did not have a DJ, Liz was up to the task.
