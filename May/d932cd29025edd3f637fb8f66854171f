The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CLOTHING Industry Workers’ Union (CIWU) FC have rejected the Southern Region Division One League’s championship dark horses tag, with coach Kudzayi Mhandire saying their target is to fight relegation from the top. CIWU powered to the top of the league table following a 2-0 win over Mainline at the weekend. Ex-Highlanders juniors’ striker Muziwakhe Dlamini and Terrence Mawire were on target for CIWU. The surprise log leaders have been quietly doing their business and now sit on 15 points from six games; one point ahead of championship favourites Bulawayo City. City mauled visiting Moto Moto 4-0, with captain Zibusiso Sibanda, industrious midfielder Thembani Masuku, Hugh Chikosa and Nqobile Ndlovu scoring for the municipal side. With City and Talen Vision breathing heavily down CIWU’s neck, Mhandire said they were targeting 30 points to be safe. “Our aim is to get to the 30 points mark as soon as possible to avoid relegation and then after that we may revise our target to a top four or top eight finish. “We can’t talk about the championship now. There’s Bulawayo City and Talen Vision, who remain favourites. “Our momentum is attracting unnecessary attention just like when dogs start barking at a moving car which they would have slept underneath before,” said Mhandire. He gave credit to his charges for gelling quickly after bringing on board seven new players. “In terms of performance, I think we’ve gone a gear up because we started our pre-season late and it’s surprising that these boys have gelled quickly as if they’ve been together for years. “The new additions have brought in a new dimension to our playing style,” said Mhandire. CIWU lost Brian Muza as well as striker Gerald Ngulube to Hwange. They brought on board goalkeeper, Deron Chuma, son to Highlanders goalkeepers’ trainer Tembo Chuma who was at Triangle United last season, central midfielder Brian Jaravaza from Highlanders, ex-Tsholotsho right-back Khaliphani Ncube and striker Keith Chikamhi from Toronto. Former Bulawayo Chiefs defender Junior Takavarasha and ex-Zim Leopards striker Tambudzai Ngulube have also become vital cogs at CIWU. Meanwhile, Gift Lunga (junior) snapped a point for his new paymasters Mosi Rovers in as 1-1 draw with Bosso 90 to move from the bottom of the table into 14th place. Nhlanhla Phiri’s brace inspired Ajax Hotspurs to a 2-1 morale boosting victory over Makomo in Hwange, while Binga Pirates recorded their first win of the season, claiming the scalp of coachless Casmyn, who fired Ndoga Nyoni last week.
