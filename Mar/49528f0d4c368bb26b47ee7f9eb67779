The Chronicle Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has directed the Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development, Professor Amon Murwira and the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Professor Paul Mavima to ensure that science subjects are taught at most schools in Beitbridge. Speaking at the commissioning of the TelOne national backbone optic fibre link in Beitbridge yesterday, President Mnangagwa said he was not happy that most children in Beitbridge are not being taught science subjects, which are vital in preparing pupils for a modern economy. “I’ve been briefed that most schools in this district do not teach Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and Physics. Fortunately, the Minister Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Professor Amon Murwira is here with us. I’m therefore instructing him and his colleague, the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education Professor Paul Mavima to address this inadequacy,” said President Mnangagwa. Most schools in Matabeleland South province continue to face an acute shortage of Mathematics and Science teachers as well as resources including laboratories for teaching the subjects. President Mnangagwa said Government was committed to ensuring an inclusive society in which all people benefit from the immense growth opportunities abound across all sectors of the economy. – @pamelashumba1
