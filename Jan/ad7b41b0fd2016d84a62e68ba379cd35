Activist Evan Mawarire will spend the weekend in remand prison after the High Court deferred to next week its ruling on his application for bail. Mawarire is facing charges of subverting a constitutional government or alternatively inciting violence following last week’s violent protests in Harare and other cities. Mawarire, the founder of #ThisFlag movement, was last week denied bail at the magistrates’ courts. He challenged the decision at the High Court. Justice Tawanda Chitapi heard arguments from both the defence and prosecution counsel. He reserved his ruling to Tuesday next week. “I want to reflect on the matter and make a written judgment,” said Justice Chitapi. “I need sufficient time. Provisionally, I defer the matter to Tuesday for judgment.” Prosecutor Mr Gwinyai Shumba opposed bail, saying Mawarire was a flight risk and a danger to society. Through his lawyer, Mr Tonderai Bhatasara, Mawarire appealed for bail, arguing the charges against him did not link him to the allegations he was facing.
