BULAWAYO Athletics Club (BAC) cricket team chairman Gary Nyumbu has said they have signed a number of players in preparation for the 2019 season. BAC were fourth last season and Nyumbu is optimistic his charges will be the team to beat this season, as they had come up with strategies to ensure success. “We’ve been looking at areas we needed reinforcements to improve from last season’s performances. We’re also building a player base by partnering with schools by identifying talent, which is part of the strategies we’re implementing to take the club forward,” said Nyumbu. “The club seeks to build from a strong base of players who will show professionalism and competitive backgrounds so that we entrust them with turning the club’s fortunes around. The club has a vision of making BAC a better place for cricket players”. He said one of BAC’s objectives has always been to identify junior players with the help of various schools in order to promote grassroots talent. “The club has identified a physio who is part of the board, to assess whether our players are in the right state to play. This on its own will give us an edge over other clubs and make us a club of choice since the well-being of players is a top priority,” Nyumbu said. “We don’t discriminate but it will be more befitting to have younger players as it will benefit both the club and the players. At a younger age, they’ll be given a platform to grow and learn a lot from experienced players, some of who have played on the international stage”. — @DecoDecent2
