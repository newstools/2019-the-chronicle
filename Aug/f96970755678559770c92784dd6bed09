The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutue, Gwanda Correspondent A 56-YEAR-OLD man has been jailed 18 years for raping and impregnating his neighbour’s 13-year-old daughter. Misheck Ndlovu of Mpisini Resettlement in Esigodini pleaded not guilty to two counts of rape when he appeared before Gwanda regional magistrate, Mr Mark Dzira, but was convicted due to overwhelming evidence. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and three years were suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar offence within the next five years. Prosecuting, Mr Mncedisi Dube said Ndlovu raped the juvenile on separate occasions in May while she was on her way from the borehole. “On 30 May at around 1PM the complainant left home to fetch water from the borehole. Ndlovu found her pumping water from the borehole and offered to assist her. After the complainant’s buckets were full Ndlovu loaded them onto a wheel barrow and offered to push it for her as they were going the same direction. “Along the way Ndlovu dragged the complainant into a bush, covered her mouth with his hand to stop her from screaming. Ndlovu raped the complainant once and warned her against reporting the matter,” he said. Mr Dube said on the following day at around 10AM the complainant went to fetch water from the borehole and on her way back she rested underneath a tree. He said Ndlovu emerged from a bush, dragged the complainant into a bush and raped once and warned her against reporting the matter. The matter was reported to the police resulting in Ndlovu’s arrest. In his defence Ndlovu had denied raping the juvenile. He said on the dates he is alleged to have committed the offence he had travelled to visit a relative. — @DubeMatutu
