The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo, Chronicle Reporter THE Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has warned farmers that beginning today, severe frost likely to affect crops and livestock, will sweep across the country. The department advised farmers to engage Agritex extension officers and invest in technologies that will protect their crops and livestock from frost. In a statement yesterday, the MSD said frost is expected to hit some parts of the country with areas such as Matobo in Matabeleland South and Gweru in the Midlands being among the worst affected. “People into horticulture, hatchery, poultry, piggery and dairy farming are advised to get appropriate advice from their agricultural extension officers on ways of mitigating the effects of frost on their crops and livestock. Frost is highly likely in susceptible places like Matopos, Gweru, Nyanga, Chivhu, Henderson and Marondera,” said the  MSD. “However, northern areas which include Mashonaland provinces, Harare Metropolitan and north of Manicaland remain relatively moist. As such, from today clear skies should be prevalent in much of the country except all Mashonaland Provinces, Harare Metropolitan and north of Manicaland provinces where brief morning clouds are expected. It will be chilly in the morning, becoming mild to warm by afternoon.” Some of the crops that are normally affected by frost during winter are tomatoes and cereals like wheat and barley. — @thamamoe
