The Chronicle IN yesterday’s Chronicle, we carried an article titled, “Interbank forex market trades US$154 million since inception”. The article was sourced from a Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) presentation in Bulawayo, which was erroneously attributed to the bank’s director for exchange control, Mr Farai Masendu. It has come to our attention that RBZ   deputy director for exports exchange control, Dr Tayengwa Chitauro, is the one who made the presentation and not Mr Masendu. We sincerely apologise for the error and regret any inconvenience caused. — Editor.
