TUSKERS marched into the final of the Pro50 Cricket Championship after winning by a remarkable eight wickets against favourites Mountaineers at Takashinga Sports Club in Harare on Saturday. The Bulawayo side will face Eagles in the final at Harare Sports Club on Friday. A brilliant second-wicket stand of 200 between Brian Chari and Craig Ervine, with both scoring centuries, propelled Tuskers to the eight-wicket win. Ervine blasted an unbeaten 111, while Chari knocked 104. Tuskers will be out for revenge against Eagles, who them in the Logan Cup in January. Zimbabwe Cricket Bulawayo provincial administrator Nicholas Singo said Tuskers had improved vastly compared to their poor showing in the Logan Cup. “The boys have been remarkable and their joy is unconfined in camp as they prepare for the final on Friday. We’re hopeful that we’ll bring the trophy home and give the fans something to cheer about,” said Singo. “When we came here (Harare) last month for the Logan Cup, we didn’t fare well, hence our match with Mountaineers was sort of some pay-back time. We suffered a devastating 114-run loss against Mountaineers, so we had to up our game as they’re good team,” he said. Tuskers displayed a brilliant display against Rhinos, completing a double over them on the road to the final of the Pro50 Championship, beating the Kwekwe-based side by 110 runs at Queens Sports Club a fortnight ago. “It is clear where the team is heading and we hope to trouble their (Eagles) batsmen and ensure the way we bowl troubles our opponents,” Singo said. — @DecoDecent2
