The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter CAPS United rule the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League roost with 20 percent of the 2019 season matches played so far in a closely contested championship race. The Green Machine, who last won the championship in 2016, are the only unbeaten team, sitting at the top of the table with 16 points from six games. Six points separate Caps United and ninth-placed Manica Diamonds, a clear indication that the title race will be tightly contested this year. Caps United took their winning streak to four consecutive games, claiming the scalp of stubborn Triangle United at Gibbo Stadium on Sunday. Caps United won the match 2-1 on a day in which defending champions FC Platinum suffered their first defeat of the season, a 1-0 loss to debutants TelOne. Caps United enjoy a one point lead over second-placed Chicken Inn, who have played one game more. They have the opportunity to extend their lead to four points when they play their outstanding Match Day Three encounter against Chapungu on Thursday. Caps United are unstoppable and getting maximum points at championship dark horses Triangle shows that they are a formidable side gunning for the title. With veterans like Method Mwanjali, last year’s Soccer Star of the Year finalist Joel Ngodzo, who is enjoying his game and  has been a consistent performer, winger Gabriel Nyoni and utility player Phineas Bhamusi, Caps United have a balanced side. Heavily breathing on Caps United’s back are Chicken Inn FC, who clobbered ailing Highlanders 3-0 at Barbourfields Stadium on Saturday in a match that saw hooligans disrupting play after the league’s leading scorer Clive Augusto struck the Gamecocks’ second goal. Augusto leads the scorers’ chart with six goals in seven matches. Brett Amidu got a double for Chicken Inn as they ran riot. With 15 points from seven games, Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas believes they are on the right track to challenge for the championship. “Look, consistency is key in our campaign and after bouncing back to beat Manica Diamonds 2-0, we had to build on that momentum when we played Highlanders. “I’m happy for the boys, but this is a marathon and we just have to try and keep our feet on the ground and keep collecting points,” said Antipas. ZPC Kariba jumped two places up the table to third after beating Ngezi Platinum Stars 1-0. The slip by FC Platinum and Hwange, who lost by identical 1-0 scorelines to TelOne and Chapungu, worked in ZPC Kariba’s favour. ZPC Kariba are tied on 15 points with                                                                                                 Chicken Inn, who have a superior goal difference. An exciting point to note is that it is Gweru-based Premiership teams that managed to hand both FC Platinum and Hwange their first defeats of the season. Chapungu are in fifth place with 13 points, three behind leaders Caps United. In the relegation side, bottom of the table Bulawayo Chiefs managed to get their first point of the season by frustrating Harare City 0-0 in the capital. Highlanders are in an unfamiliar territory, occupying the second from the bottom slot, with Yadah, who lost 1-0 to Dynamos, and Mushowani Stars, who edged Black Rhinos 2-0, occupying the other relegation slots. Herentals, Triangle and Harare City are tied on seven points, with Rhinos on eight points and TelOne on nine points.
