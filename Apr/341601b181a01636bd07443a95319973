The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation has taken up all exhibition space in Hall 2 for the 60th edition of the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair and implored various sports bodies to take advantage of this space by exhibiting. This year’s trade fair, which is being held under the theme “Propagating Industrial Growth through Trade and Investment”, will run from April 23-27. “As a Ministry we have taken up Hall 2 as we want all those associated with the ministry to be under one roof. We wanted to have a one stop facility. It’s not only ideal, but it also makes accessibility much easier for visitors,” said Benson Dube, chairperson of the ministry’ committee on ZITF. Dube though expressed concern about interest from sports bodies in utilising the facility provided by the ministry. “We tasked our various parastatals like the Arts Council and the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) to canvas for their members to utilise this facility and I am not sure if they did that because as of now, we haven’t received any takers. If, however, there are sports associations or clubs that have already booked exhibition space at the ZITF on their own, we would like them to liaise with us and ZITF management so that they come to Hall 2,” said Dube. He said they had reserved 49 cubicles in Hall 2 of which 20 have since been taken up by the ministry itself. Last year, the Premier Soccer League and six of its clubs, Highlanders, FC Platinum, Ngezi Platinum, Herentals, Harare City and Bulawayo City exhibited at the Trade Fair. With 14 foreign nations set to exhibit, including the United States of America who are returning after a three-year absence, the fair provides a perfect opportunity for Zimbabwean sporting institutions to market their brands, which is also in line with sport tourism. This year’s ZITF will be officially opened by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on April 26.
