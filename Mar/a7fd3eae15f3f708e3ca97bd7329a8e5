The book that was published by Methuen Publishing in the United Kingdom in January offers a rich and diverse portrait of identity, politics, culture, gender issues and society in contemporary Africa. It is available online on Google Books. “I Want to Fly” tells the story of an African girl who wants to be a pilot. It also looks at how patriarchal society shapes the thinking of men regarding lobola (bride price), how women endure abusive men and the role society at large plays in these issues. The playwright, who is a former Amakhosi Theatre student, said: “I was so honoured when my play was selected to be in this book among other great plays by some of the finest playwrights on the continent. “I’m inspired by what I see in society and I reflect it in my plays. In “I Want to Fly”, the main theme is patriarchy which is still taking place today in our society,” said Moyo.
