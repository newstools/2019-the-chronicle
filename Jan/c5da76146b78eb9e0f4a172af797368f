The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo
A group of Masvingo’s seasoned and up-and-coming artistes will perform tomorrow at Caravan Park for a memorial concert dedicated to the late national hero and global music icon, Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi. Tuku died at the Avenues Clinic in Harare last Wednesday after battling diabetes for a long time and was declared a national hero. The show which will also feature veteran singer, Uncle Jahunda, Great Zimbabwe University Ensemble and Alchemy Tkey of the Realness promises to be a thriller. The organiser of the show, Yvonne Shumbanhete said the event would provide local artistes a platform to pay their tribute to the great man. She said Mtukudzi’s death touched many and Masvingo wanted to show that in style with other artistes having composed songs dedicated to the late icon. She said Caravan Park was chosen because it was the last venue where Tuku performed in October last year alongside Winky D. “We chose Caravan Park ahead of other venues, as we felt it was where he last performed. Tuku lit up the whole town with his tantalising display and we want to rekindle those memories as some artistes will also play his music, in remembrance,” she said. She said Tuku’s music appeals to people of all ages that nothing short of a bumper crowd was expected. The Blacks Spirits front man was buried on Sunday at his rural home in Madziwa, Mashonaland Central where the who is who in the music industry, politics and churches thronged the homestead. — @walterbmswazie2
