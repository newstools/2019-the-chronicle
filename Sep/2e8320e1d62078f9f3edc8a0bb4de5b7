The Chronicle Michell Zvanyanya Milton High School in Bulawayo has over the years produced well-rounded pupils who go on to do well in their chosen career paths. The school offers day and boarding school facilities from Form One to Form Six. Demand for enrolment has become progressively high with the total enrolment currently standing at 902, an increase from 850 which was recorded last year. Among the 902 pupils, 70 are boarders — an increase from the 38 boys that were enrolled as boarders last year. The increase in the number of enrolled pupils has been a milestone for the school, which is optimistic of attaining a higher pass rate from this year’s November public examinations. The November 2018 O-Level results obtained by the school asserted the school as one of the best schools in the city. Milton High School is results- oriented and represents excellence in academics. Milton High School headmaster, Mr Similo Ncube, said the school has made significant strides in remaining as one of the best schools in the region and a look at the November 2018 results says it all. “I’m quite impressed by the performance of the Milton boys last year. The O-Level results were outstanding. In Geography we have 29 As, in Ndebele we have 16 As, 17 As in Heritage Studies, in Combined Science we have 13 As, three in English Language and in Maths we have 7 As,” he said. Mr Ncube was happy with the exceptional performance in Heritage Studies saying it reflects how the institution is successfully implementing and embracing the new competence-based curriculum that seeks to churn out the best pupils. “Our pupils sat Heritage Studies exams for the first time last year but surprisingly they performed exceptionally well in the subject. This shows that the pupils are positively embracing the new curriculum. One of our pupils who was showcasing at the National Annual Science Sports and Arts Festival (Nassaf) went away with a silver medal that made us proud. This clearly reflects the school’s efforts in embracing the curriculum,” he said. The school adopted a five-year development plan and it has achieved more than three quarters of its development goals set in 2016. As part of its development goals, the school has successfully refurbished the school bus which has been a top priority in the plan as it carries the school’s image through the labelled popular motto “Quit ye like men.” This year, the school is celebrating its 109th annual speech and prize giving day which has been a tradition of the school since the institution’s inception. The event is set aside on an annual basis to recognise and celebrate each year’s achievements. It is commemorated to take stock of the school’s shortcomings and to celebrate excelling pupils. <img class="wp-image-468235 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Milton-deputy-head-Mr-Mazibuko-shows-off-trophies.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Milton-deputy-head-Mr-Mazibuko-shows-off-trophies.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/Milton-deputy-head-Mr-Mazibuko-shows-off-trophies-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Milton deputy head, Mr Mazibuko, shows off trophies This year, the guest of honour, who is also a respected professional, Mr Kudzai Midza will grace the speech and prize giving event. Not only does the school excel in academics but it also outshines other schools in the province and the country at large in extra-curricular activities, particularly sports. Mr Ncube spoke highly of pupils who are excelling in different competitions for various disciplines in and out of Zimbabwe. “The school came first this year in the Nassaf game competitions and the boys in the Heritage Team also went away with a silver medal despite it being a new area for them. “Our karate boys scooped a silver medal at national level this year. The rugby team also participated in the Dairyboard Festival which was an international event and our boys had the opportunity to reach that level,” he said. “On October 4, the school will host Nash drama competitions where our drama group will be showcasing.” — @michellzvanyanyan2.
