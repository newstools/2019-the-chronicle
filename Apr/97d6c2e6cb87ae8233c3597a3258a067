The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THE Chicken Inn couple took their relationship to another level this past Sunday after Makhosana Mguni paid bride price (lobola) for his fiancé Belinda Nyoni. The couple is now preparing for a white wedding in December. Last year, the lovers, who are now commonly referred to as the Chicken Inn couple, trended after an image of Makhosana on bended knee asking for Belinda’s hand in marriage at Chicken Inn Drive Thru in Bulawayo went viral on social media. Initially, Makhosana was mocked for this gesture but when Chicken Inn endorsed him and his partner, the whole country fell in love with the couple and they became overnight celebrities. They were flown to Harare courtesy of Chicken Inn where they were made brand ambassadors of the fast food outlet. <img class="size-medium wp-image-445585" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Belinda-Nyoni-and-Makhosana-Mguni-1-360x300.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="300" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Belinda-Nyoni-and-Makhosana-Mguni-1-360x300.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Belinda-Nyoni-and-Makhosana-Mguni-1-768x640.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Belinda-Nyoni-and-Makhosana-Mguni-1-680x567.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Belinda-Nyoni-and-Makhosana-Mguni-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Belinda Nyoni and Makhosana Mguni Close sources to the couple said the wedding day has been set for December 26. “Makhosana fulfilled Belinda’s parents’ wishes in terms of lobola this past weekend. “They were happy after the ceremony at West Acre.
