The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya in Beitbridge TRANSPORTERS and customs clearing agents at Beitbridge Border Post have raised concern over delays in the movement of cargo following adoption of a new customs clearance procedure. Concerned clients said they started experiencing delays in the last three weeks after the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) introduced a new model of confirming payments for several levies and duties on commercial cargo imports. Where payments used to reflect within 30 minutes in the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA World), it was now taking 24 hours or more, they said. The introduction of duty top ups emanating from the fluctuating exchange rates between the RTGS and United States dollars, have worsened the situation, said the transporters. Under the ASCYUDA world facility, clients submit their customs documents from anywhere in the world provided there is internet connectivity. “We are worried with the status quo where payments have to be confirmed in 24 hours on ASYCUDA. This set up is delaying the movement of cargo and some trucks are taking over a week to enter the country. “In some instances we are having challenges on the cancellation of documents on the clearance system. This needs to be addressed urgently,” said a customs clearing agent who preferred anonymity. Chairman of Beitbridge Transporters Association Mr Osbert Shumba confirmed the development. <img class="size-medium wp-image-443328" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Trucks-waiting-in-line-at-the-boarder-post0Acargo-trucks-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Trucks-waiting-in-line-at-the-boarder-post0Acargo-trucks-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Trucks-waiting-in-line-at-the-boarder-post0Acargo-trucks-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Trucks-waiting-in-line-at-the-boarder-post0Acargo-trucks-680x529.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Trucks-waiting-in-line-at-the-boarder-post0Acargo-trucks.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> cargo trucks “We have had several complaints from our members about the delays linked to the prepayment confirmations on ASYCUDA world. These (delays) are affecting our cost of doing business. “You will note that one used to clear cargo in less than a day, but importers now have to go through the same process over a week and this is not good for business. “We understand Zimra is now updating the payments manually on ASYCUDA from their headquarters in Harare and this is causing delays,” he said. Mr Shumba said they were engaging Zimra with the view of finding a solution to the delays. Mr Shumba said although there were delays in reflection of the prepayments on the system, they were happy with the recent splitting of export and imports clearance. “The clearance of both export and import cargo at one desk was causing unnecessary delays. However, it is pleasing to note that Zimra has opened two separate desks to deal with imports and exports,” said Mr Shumba. Zimra head of corporate communications Mr Francis Chimanda, however, said that movement of cargo within the borders was normal. “The clearance and movement of cargo at Beitbridge Border Post is normal and payment of duties and taxes are reflecting in the ZIMRA system on the same day. We are processing an average of 250 commercial importation transactions daily. “In addition, the turnaround time for a correct commercial declaration is three hours. You will also note that cancellations are being done on a daily basis, and renewal of clearing agents’ licenses commences in October each year to allow clearing agents to deal with any outstanding issues before commencement of the New Year in January,” he said.
