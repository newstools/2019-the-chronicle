The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter ZIMDANCEHALL musician, Guspy Warrior, will be in Bulawayo tomorrow for a performance at Vintage Shisha Bar (formerly Exchange Bar). The Seunononga hit-maker, who will be backed by the bar’s resident DJs Kaize, Craig and Joe, said he was thrilled to be performing in the city as he has not been here in a very long time. The show, he said, would be special as it will also be a Valentine’s Day celebration. “Those who’ll attend the event will exclusively sample one of my new tracks off my upcoming album. I concluded work on the album last year and will likely release it in April,” Guspy Warrior said. Event organiser, Terminator Makoni, said they had lined up a series of shows in Bulawayo featuring local acts in order to keep the city’s music lovers well entertained. “We want to give Bulawayo fans real value for their money. Over the years, people have been starved of real live entertainment and this year, we promise to give them performances from most, if not all of the top Zimbabwean artistes. “It’s time we support local,” said Terminator. Admission to the show has been pegged at $5bond. It is hoped that Guspy Warrior, who has been off the limelight for some time, will reignite his relationship with Bulawayo fans at the show with the performance of classics like Seunononga and Joze.
