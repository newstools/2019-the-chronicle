Khaya Arts director Future Dube said it is their hope to bring the crown home while also ensuring their dance ensemble grows. “It’s our first time to be in the Dreamstar competition and we’re glad to have made it to the finals. We’re now working hard to ensure we promote the Khaya Arts brand and win the competition too,” Dube said. “We’re thoroughly preparing for the event as we want to make our city proud.” The group which celebrated their ninth anniversary in March is now calling on sponsors to assist in terms of costumes, camp preparations and artistic ideas in ensuring they win the competition.

Nonetheless, we’re confident that we’ll still produce a top-class show, one that all Zimbabweans can be proud of.” He said the ultimate winner will receive a grand prize of $3 000, a recording deal with Dreamstar’s recording label JCMC Studios and an opportunity to travel to China among many other prizes.
