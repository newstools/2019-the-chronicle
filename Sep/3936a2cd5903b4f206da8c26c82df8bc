The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE 62nd edition of the Townshend and Butcher football tournament will get underway tomorrow with a host of exciting matches on the cards. Social soccer teams affiliated to the Zifa Bulawayo Province Area Zones will feature in this year’s edition. Leagues under the jurisdiction of Bulawayo Area Zones are Bafa, Bulawayo Social Soccer League, Bulawayo Christian League, Ntabazinduna Amateur Football League (Ntafa), Golden Oldies’ Social League and Wololani Football League. In the past only teams in the Bulawayo Amateur Football Association (Bafa) took part in the competition but this year teams outside Bafa have been included. Sponsor Peter Leondios said: “I love the game because I used to be a soccer player. I therefore want people to enjoy what l used to enjoy when l was a soccer player. I started sponsoring this tournament in 1986 and l can tell you the tournament gets better with each passing year. We get more talented players almost every year. “As long as l live the competition will continue. If you go into the archives you will see that we have had some players who have made it in the topflight league making a name for themselves at this tournament.” Bulawayo giants Highlanders and Zimbabwe Saints played in this tournament before joining the then Super League. Townshend and Butcher Sports Shop has stood with Bafa, sponsoring what has become the league’s premier knockout tournament.
