The Chronicle Keith Mlauzi, Showbiz Reporter RHUMBA band Diamond Musica was charmed by the crowd in Bulawayo as people turned out in their numbers to witness the Harare-based Congolese outfit perform. Band Leader Pitshou Lumiere said the band, which was amazed by the high turnout at Alliance Française on Saturday, will be returning to the City of Kings to perform here often. “I thought we were going to perform for a small crowd but I was shocked because it seemed as if the whole of Bulawayo had come to our show “We were surprised by the turnout and our hearts melted when we looked at the crowds. This was a wakeup call for us and we’ll be coming back to Bulawayo more often,” said Lumiere. The band was last in Bulawayo 17 years ago. What made the show – a free event – more special for the band was that the crowds – who are known as deep SA house music fans, sang along to all the songs that were performed – showing how acquainted they were with the music. In honour of the late music icon – Oliver Mtukudzi – Diamond Musica performed Bhutsu, a song they collaborated on with the late hero. The rhumba group did not just attract music lovers, but arts promoters. “Immediately after the show, we were approached by a group of promoters asking us to come back to Bulawayo for more shows,” said Lumiere. He said fellow musicians from the city also attended the event which was part of the Francophonie Week celebrations. Some artistes who were spotted in the crowd were Djembe Monks, Mimmie Tarukwana and comedian Maforty.
