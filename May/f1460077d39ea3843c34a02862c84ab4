The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma WITH beer price hikes dampening the party mood at most nightclubs countrywide, the newly introduced #UltimateCoolerBox party in Gweru will likely change the game in the City of Progress. The festival, which is now being held monthly, is unique in that it accommodates low and high spenders as patrons are allowed to bring their liquor. This has come as a relief to many fun lovers who nowadays prefer to drink from their cars as they cannot afford to buy drinks at nightclubs. With this festival taking place at Barnah Gardens tomorrow, one just has to load their cooler box and make their way to the venue for the second edition. Event organiser Jackson “Zimboy” Muchechetere said all was in place for the event which will be headlined by South Africa-based, DJ Trill Angel, BAC Leisure’s DJ Prince Eskhosini, DJ Patch, sensational dancer Kikky BadaA$$ and comedian Ray Vines. More entertainment will be provided by Zimdancehall artiste Legion who is fresh from a South African musical tour, Munya Unruly, G Fresh, El Xnder, Loova and DJ’s Mupsy, Crocx, Blesh, Masty, Tunemaster, Nelz, Nell Thando, Luvex, Oxygen and The Doc. “All is set for the event which is set to start at midday. The beer lovers of Gweru should come in their numbers as this event is a way of saving from the steep prices charged at nightspots. “We’ll allow them to get in with their cooler boxes,” Zimboy said. He said advance tickets are already being sold for RTGS$10. At the venue, general tickets will be sold for RTGS$20. Shisha smokers, Zimboy said, have been catered for as a shisha bar will be in place. Children will be treated to jumping castles and swimming tubs. – @mthabisi_mthire
