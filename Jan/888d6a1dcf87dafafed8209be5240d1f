A WELL-WISHER has come to Ajax Hotspurs Football Club’s rescue and paid $1 480 to Zifa Bulawayo Province for the Mpopoma based side’s outstanding dues after the Division Two champions got promoted to the Southern Region First Division. Ajax stormed back to the Southern Region Division One following a five-year absence, in an unbeaten record of 20 wins and 10 draws. Club director Siphambaniso Dube said the club is geared for next season as they seek to return the good gesture shown by the well wisher by avoiding relegation. “We’re grateful to those who have come to rescue us by providing us with monetary and all different forms of support. Another sponsor is promising to assist with referees’ fees for the whole year as a result the club is motivated and can’t wait to get the ball rolling,” said Dube. “We are calling for more partners to come forward and help build the brand Ajax Hotspurs in our endeavour to promote football development in Bulawayo and Zimbabwe. We are desperately in need of help with affiliation fees which can be payable direct to Zifa Southern Region Soccer League,” Dube said. Dube said Ajax is being owed close to $12 000 in developmental fees by big clubs, which if paid in full, all their problems will be solved. Ajax have produced top talent such as Divine Lunga, who now plays for South African Premiership side Lamontville Golden Arrows, 2016 Soccer Star of the Year finalist with Highlanders, defender, Peter Muduhwa, Denzel Khumalo, Mbongeni Ndlovu and Chrispen Machisi. – @DecoDecent2
