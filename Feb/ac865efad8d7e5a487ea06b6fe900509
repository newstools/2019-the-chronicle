POLICE in Matabeleland South are investigating a case of suspected murder after a man was found dead following a beer binge with friends in Filabusi. Advance Bhepe (23) of Bekezela Township was last seen drinking Gold Blend Whisky at a bar at Garikayi Township with his two friends, Prince Sibanda (19) and Nhlanhla Moyo (22) also from the same township. He was last seen at around 9PM on Friday and was found dead at around 5AM on the next day. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele yesterday confirmed the incident saying investigations were underway. Chief Insp Ndebele also appealed to members of the public who may have information on what may have happened to the deceased to contact their nearest police station. Bekezela Township Residents’ Association chairperson, Mr Lameck Ndlovu, said the incident was tragic. He said at around 9PM on Friday, the now deceased borrowed Moyo’s Honda Fit vehicle and left the two at a bar saying he was going home. “After a while he phoned the two indicating that he had been involved in a minor accident, with the car having been dented lightly. “The trio met and it was agreed he gets the car fixed as soon as possible. “The now deceased phoned his wife telling her that he was going to a certain mechanic’s house in Mthwakazi Township to get the car fixed and that was the last seen of him,” said Mr Ndlovu. He said the community was devastated by the loss of a young potential life and hoped that the law would take its course. —@winnie_masara
