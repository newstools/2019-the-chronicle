The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondent CAR rental company Impala Car Hire has given Selmor Mtukudzi a car, leaving her out of words describing the gesture as grace. Revealing the news on her Facebook page with pictures of her in tears of joy Selmor said she could not resist sharing the goodness of God. The car looks like a Mazda Demio. “I was told not to say anything but ndatadza kurara ini. I have to share the goodness of God. Vanhuwee ndibatsireiwo kutenda mota iri apa iyi ndangoipihwa mufunge. Kupihwa kunzi tora hako yaayako. Ini handisati ndambozviona zvakadaro. Words fail me. Uku hakusimbori kugona kwangu, inyasha. Thank you so much to madhara angu, who have taken the father figure role in my life now. May the good Lord bless you abundantly and may He enlarge your territories. Mr Dondo, Mwari vakuitirei zvakanaka. <img class="alignnone wp-image-443709" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/FB_IMG_1554358848745-360x223.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="429" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/FB_IMG_1554358848745-360x223.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/FB_IMG_1554358848745.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /> “(I was told not to say anything, but couldn’t sleep, I just had to share, and I had to share the goodness of God. Please help me give thanks, the car that you see here was given to me. I have never experienced anything like this. Words fail me. This is not because of my abilities, but it is grace. Thank you so much to my elders who have taken the father figure in my life now. May the good Lord bless you abundantly and may He enlarge your territories, Mr Dondo).” Selmor was accompanied by her husband, Tendai Manatsa and her sister Sandra who doubles up as her manager and the trio was pictured taking the car for a spin. During the drive, Tendai shared a picture of the trio while Selmor driving captioned: “Selmor arikuti nyimawo kudriver mota. (Selmor is refusing to let us drive the car also).” It is reported at one time Impala Car Hire and rental used to sponsor her father, the late Oliver Mtukudzi. Impala Car Hire were also one of the sponsors for the highly successful inaugural Star FM Music Awards at the beginning of this year.
