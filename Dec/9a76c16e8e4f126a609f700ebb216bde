The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO Athletics Board (Bab) chairperson Manuel Mpofu says he will not seek re-election at the association’s elective annual general meeting in 2020. Mpofu tookover as Bab chairman in 2011 following resignation of the then chairperson Vusumuzi Mlilo due to ill health. In 2013 he was elected chairperson for a full four-year cycle, which ended in 2016 and was re-elected unopposed to run the association up to 2020. “I feel like l have given it my all. It is time for someone else to take over and bring in new ideas to take the association forward. With my experience I will be doing administrative work at the Naaz office at White City Stadium in Bulawayo,” he said. Mpofu’s athletics journey began at Sabi Mine Athletics Club in Zvishavane before he joined Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services as a prison officer in 1996. He joined the Matabeleland North Athletics Board as a fully affiliated member. “As a fully affiliated member of the board I was invited to officiate at various events in the province. At some of the events I even competed in shot put and discus. I attained Level 1 certificates in coaching and officiating,” he said. When Bab was established in 2006, he was elected committee member and has been with the association ever since. During his tenure as chairperson, Mpofu has overseen the establishment of the Bab annual awards and staging of successful competitions.  – @innocentskizoe
