The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter BULAWAYO Hip Hop musician POY says he wants to empower up-and-coming artistes with financial literacy through his company, Evolve Ambush Marketing. The rapper said with the experience he has accumulated in the music industry since 1999 when he ventured into music, he has seen it fit to use that knowledge to empower up-and-coming artistes. “With Evolve Ambush Marketing, we’re specialising in marketing and distributing music. At the moment, we’re working with a young artiste called Six-Oh and we’re building his brand. “Last year, we facilitated a slot for him on Coke on the beat and this year, he was featured on ZBCtv’s Woza Friday,” said POY. POY, who is behind the Bahle hit, said their main aim as a company is to teach the young artistes financial literacy and how to take on music as a business. “I’ve managed to make a decent living off music as I receive money every month from online streams and shows. Now I’m involved in the meat industry and real estate so I want to enlighten upcoming artistes as well.” The Hip Hop musician said this year he wants to improve the quality of his music videos and would want to work with renowned videographers like Vusa Blaqs and Andy Cutta. “Videos are very crucial. The recent video for my song Bahle has been accepted to be playlisted on Channel O and that gives my music more exposure. So if I put more effort in improving the quality of my videos, my music will have more chances of being played on the big platforms,” he said. The rapper, who is billed to perform alongside Zimdancehall chanters Seh Calaz and Hwindi President at The Vista on April 5, said he would be releasing a lot of singles this year in order to remain relevant. He said he does not want to produce an album because everyone expects him to do so, but will do so when the right time comes.
