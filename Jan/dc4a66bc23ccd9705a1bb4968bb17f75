Zimdancehall musicians, Killer T and Jah Signal, yesterday honoured the late Oliver Mtukudzi with tribute songs. Just hours after it was announced that Mtukudzi had died, Killer T dropped his Tuku tribute song titled Mundireverere, a mournful track in which he expresses his grief. In the song Killer T laments: “Tiri kuchema mudhara Tuku matisiya, vana vanochema mudhara wedu matisiya. Newewo Sam tambirawo baba, gadzirai nzira vawane pekufamba napo.” (We are mourning Tuku’s death. Sam [Tuku’s son who died in 2010] welcome your father). <img class=" wp-image-418494" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Jah-Signal-360x217.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="406" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Jah-Signal-360x217.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Jah-Signal.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /> Jah Signal Fast-rising Jah Signal also released his tribute offering, Pasi Pano in which he expresses his sadness about the death of the superstar: “Ndabvuma pasi pano hapazi pedu, Mwari munoita kuda kwenyu.” (I now realise all of us will die.
