The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter DESPITE a 100 percent start to the season without conceding a goal, Bulawayo City are not getting carried away by their early form and are aware that tougher games await them. Amakhosi have scored eight goals in their opening two games; first beating Arenel 5-0 in the season opener before handing Victoria Falls’ Mosi Rovers a 3-0 drubbing to go top of the Zifa Southern Region Division One League table. “It’s a marathon, we are not carried away by these wins even though it’s not a secret that we want to make an early return to the Premier Soccer League. The whole dressing room is fully aware of our major objectives, but we are also aware that tougher opponents await us as the season progresses,” said head coach, Try Ncube. He said unity of purpose from everyone associated with the team will help them achieve their goal of returning to the elite league as quickly as possible, adding that serious challenges lie ahead. “We have other title contenders like Talen Vision, Ciwu and Hwange teams that are always a thorn in the flesh year in and year out. Our boys are also aware of pending threats from these teams, but just like them, we are ready as we can only win promotion by getting the better of them. We don’t want permutations where our qualification is dependent on other results. Our wish is to determine our fate on our own,” said Ncube. Tomorrow City make the long trip to Binga for a date with league debutants, Binga Pirates, hoping to continue with their fine run.
