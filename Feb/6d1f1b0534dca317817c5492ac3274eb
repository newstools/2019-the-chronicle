FIRST Mobile Sports Academy, which plays in the Zifa Bulawayo Junior League, last week honoured two of its players that excelled in their O-Level examinations last year. Simbarashe Madzivire of Sizane High School got 2As, 3Bs and 2Cs, while Andile Dlodlo of Njube High School scored 5As, 3Bs and 2Cs. “As First Mobile Sports Academy, we sincerely believe that our players must be able to adequately know how to balance sports and their education. It’s critical that they do that, hence our decision to honour these two youngsters,” said Sithandazile Dube, an executive committee member of the academy. Speaking at the same occasion, Njube High School deputy headmistress Sikhulile Sibanda thanked First Mobile Sports Academy for realising the importance of education instead of only concentrating on football. “Our boy, Andile has put Njube High school on the map. Sometimes kids lack proper exposure and guidance and we are convinced Andile has that guidance at First Mobile Sports Academy,” said Sibanda. Dlodlo said he will continue playing football as he also pursues his academic career. “Football is part of my life, but I am also keen to do well in my studies,” said Dlodlo. The function was attended by Zifa Bulawayo chairman, Francis Ntutha and board member Allan Mpofu, who also sits in the First Mobile Sports Academy’s executive committee.
