The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A 28-YEAR-OLD Bulawayo woman yesterday appeared in court facing charges of stealing R1 500, US$120 and clothes worth RTGS$700 from her boyfriend while he was at work. Nozinhle Ndlovu of Emganwini suburb allegedly stole the money, five new T-shirts and three new Chino pairs of trousers from Mr Matthew Moyo (26) of the same suburb. Ndlovu and Mr Moyo, the court heard, had been in a relationship for more than a year. Ndlovu pleaded not guilty to theft when she appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Gladmore Mushove. She was remanded out of custody for continuation of trial. Ndlovu told the court that Mr Moyo would sometimes give her money for safekeeping and she decided to keep some of the money at her cousin’s place. “He gave me US$65 and R1 100 for safe keeping. I took the money to my cousin for safe keeping. The following day I decided to visit my child in Esigodini and I used some of the money. When I returned from Esigodini I stayed with my aunt in Gwabalanda suburb,” she said. She said she knew nothing about the pairs of trousers and T-shirts. In response, Mr Moyo said his girlfriend just disappeared without telling him anything. “Nozinhle is my girlfriend of one year and we stay together. On the day in question she just disappeared without saying anything and when I got home from work on the same day, I discovered that she had taken the money I had given her for safe keeping, my pairs of trousers and T-shirts without my consent,” he said. — -@zinyuke98
