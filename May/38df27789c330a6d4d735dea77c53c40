The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent UP-and-coming musicians from the border town of Plumtree C4 (Yusuf Banda) and RS (Simz Ncube) have chronicled their fight against drug abuse and crime through music. The two artistes, who are now based in South Africa, have recorded a prayer song called Masithandaze with the hope of empowering some who might be going through what they went through. The gospel track that is fused with Kasi Rap was recorded and mastered in South Africa and released last week. It features SA-based vocalist Carol. One of the artistes, C4, said he has seen and done it all and is grateful that God has kept him alive. “I’ve committed crime and did the time. I’ve seen people getting shot under my nose and impregnated women among other things. I’m not proud of that but I’m glad that my life is in God’s hands now,” said C4. “I call it God’s engineering and I’m very grateful for everything He has done for me so far.” The artistes’ manager, Handsome Sibanda, said the prayer song chronicles what the two artistes went through and how they used prayer to overcome it all. “The two are chronicling the struggles they faced in their past lives including overcoming drugs, crime, poverty and holding on to prayer in those trying times,” said Sibanda. “The song is receiving heavy rotation on local stations such as Skyz Metro FM and Breeze FM.” Sibanda said C4, who is working on his EP, will have a homecoming show in Plumtree after the EP is out.
