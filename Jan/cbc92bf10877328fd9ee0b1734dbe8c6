The Chronicle End of Year Adjustments
-Employees are expected to reconcile their payrolls and ensure the correct tax is collected per employee by end of the year. – At the end of the year, the employer must make final adjustments to Pay As You Earn (P.A.Y.E.) calculations taking into account the total income, deductions, and credits to which the employee is entitled. – In the case of shortfalls, the employer is obliged to make good the shortfalls, remit the tax, and recover the shortfalls from employees on the final payroll. Where there are refunds employers should also refund the employees on the final payroll for the year. The employer should then extract the ITF 16 Return and submit to ZIMRA by 30 January 2019. -The following e-mail addresses should be used to submit the ITF16 Returns: i) fdsChiredzi@zimra.co.zw ii) fdsGweru@zimra.co.zw iii) fdsHarare@zimra.co.zw iv) fdsHwange@zimra.co.zw v) fdsKadoma@zimra.co.zw vi) fdsKwekwe@zimra.co.zw vii) fdsMasvingo@zimra.co.zw viii) fdsMhlbyo@zimra.co.zw ix) fdsMutare@zimra.co.zw v) fdsVicFalls@zimra.co.zw Issue of Tax Certificates -All employees whose remuneration was subject to P.A.Y.E. are entitled to be issued with tax certificates (forms P6) for their records. -The employer is required to issue forms P6 within 30 days from the end of the relevant year or within 30 days of terminating employment services as the case may be. -Forms P6 for the employees who are employed by the same employer for the full tax year should be marked F.D.S. on the face.
