The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter TIGERS lost their fourth consecutive match after succumbing to a 53-run loss to defending champions Blazers in a Spar Bonsa T20 League at the Old Mutual Heath Streak Academy on Sunday. The result left Tigers languishing at the bottom of the league table with seven points from eight games. Their only victory was a seven-wicket win over Sabres three weeks ago. Tigers captain Farai Gunda believes his side is good enough, they make too many costly mistakes as a team. “We are not losing games because the opponent is good, but we are losing games as a result of our own small mistakes. In T20 cricket those small mistakes are costly,” said Gunda. “We are just going to play cricket. The players we have know what is required of them. It is the execution part which is the problem,” he said. Results Saturday: Tigers 110-8 (20 overs) v Raptors 111-5 (18 overs) *Raptors won by five wickets.
