The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent TWO Gwanda siblings have been arrested after they allegedly stabbed their friend four times in the chest resulting in his death in a dispute over sharing of beer. Thembelani (29) and Innocent Sibanda (20) from Zelezele Village in Guyu were not asked to plead when they appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Mrs Nomagugu Sibanda facing a murder charge. They were remanded in custody to October 25. Prosecuting, Miss Faith Mutukwa said Thembelani, Innocent and the now deceased Keith Ndlovu were drinking beer at Takaliyawa Business Centre when a misunderstanding ensued. “Ndlovu started complaining that Thembelani was drinking too much beer yet he had not paid for it. Ndlovu tried to stop him from drinking but this didn’t go down well with him resulting in a misunderstanding. “Thembelani and Ndlovu started fighting and Innocent joined in assisting Thembelani to assault Ndlovu. Innocent produced a knife and handed it over to Thembelani who stabbed Ndlovu four times in the chest. Other patrons who were at the same business centre restrained Thembelani and innocent from attacking Ndlovu further,” she said. Miss Mutukwa said Ndlovu was rushed to the nearest clinic where he was declared dead on arrival. She said Innocent and Thembelani fled from the scene. Miss Mutukwa said the matter was reported to the police who conducted investigations resulting in the arrest of the accused persons. She said a blood-stained knife which is suspected to have been used to commit the offence was recovered at the house of the accused as well as blood stained clothes. — @DubeMatutu.
