The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter HWANGE-based Imvelo Safari Lodges has donated equipment and stationery worth more than $100 000 to three institutions in Sidinda Ward 8 in the district. The gesture is part of the company’s corporate social responsibility meant to uplift livelihoods and complement Government development efforts. The beneficiaries, which are all administered by Hwange Rural District Council, are Sidinda Clinic, Sidinda Primary and Lumbora Secondary School as well as a women’s sewing club and a local social soccer team. The donation included stationery, desks and chairs for the two schools, wheelchairs, a theatre bed and other hospital equipment for the clinic. The three institutions also got laptops. Imvelo programmes coordinator Mr Sambulo Moyo said the gesture was meant to thank the community of Hwange where the company operates. “We have operated here for a number of years since the 1990s, our partners identified areas of need resulting in this donation,” said Mr Moyo. He said the company had also adopted some pupils and was paying their school fees as well as buying uniforms. Mr Moyo said the company will also buy bicycles for all the pupils it has adopted. Acting Hwange District Medical Officer Dr Seleman Saidi said the donation will go a long way in ensuring the local community has access to primary health care. Chief Whange recently appealed to companies exploiting resources in the district to plough back to communities. Ministries of Health and Child Care, Primary and Secondary Education officials and other stakeholders attended the event. —@ncubeleon
