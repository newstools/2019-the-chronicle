The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A HONDA Fit driver allegedly kidnapped and robbed a passenger but failed to rape her because she was menstruating . Jonathan Mpofu (36) from New Lobengula suburb in Bulawayo allegedly robbed the woman, whose name has been withheld for ethical reasons, of groceries valued at $624. Mpofu pleaded not guilty to kidnap, attempted rape and robbery charges before West Commonage magistrate, Ms Sibongile Marondedze. He was remanded in custody to today for continuation of trial. Prosecuting, Ms Concilia Ncube said on February 10 this year, the complainant boarded an Emakhandeni suburb-bound Honda Fit in the city centre which had other five passengers. She said the driver dropped all the five passengers and the complainant was the only one left. “On their way to victim’s place of residence, the driver diverted the route to Masiyephambili Drive near Ngozi Mine dump site and demanded sex at knife point,” said the prosecutor. Ms Ncube said Mpofu unbuttoned the complainant’s trousers only to find out that she was menstruating. “Mpofu became frustrated and robbed the victim of her groceries that included 1kg biscuits, Cremora powdered milk, pilchard fish, soap, noodles, Cerevita, a rim of bond paper and cornflakes,” she said. The court heard that police launched investigations leading to Mpofu’s arrest.—@sharonbuwe
