The Chronicle Response to “We’ve no business in MDC fights: Zanu-PF”. Let them fight their own battles . The issue is that Chamisa knows that at the congress he will not win. His team is trying by all means to tarnish the image of Mwonzora in the party to stop him from contesting the post at MDC congress. – Mupfawi. Response to “State-assisted funeral for Mothobi”. Rest in peace Comrade Mthobi, we appreciate all the work that you did for the betterment of our country. We will never forget you. -Arnod77. Response to “Mangudya to appear before parly committee”. The committee is really good as it seeks transparency in important sectors. — Darlington Mhaka. Response to “International bidders for Zim dam projects”. Since our country depends on agriculture, there is great need for more irrigation schemes to supplement the water shortage and to make sure we don’t miss huge yields. Let these investors come in their numbers to construct more dams. Our agricultural output/yields will add to the economic development of the country when exported. – Tinoda Mupfawi. Response to “First Lady challenges churches, corporates”. If more players join in the programme, the message will spread to each and every corner and very soon Harare will gain world class status. – Dalubuhle Nkosana.
