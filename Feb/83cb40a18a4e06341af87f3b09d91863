THE Venue FC is looking for partnerships to help the side make a huge impression in its maiden season in the Zifa Central Region Division One League. The Maphisa-based team will be playing Division One football for the first time this season after winning the Zifa Matabeleland South Division Two League Pool A. Bokani Ndlovu, a businesswoman who sponsors the club, said the team is seeking partnerships with corporate organisations or individuals to ensure that its stint in the second tier league is not short lived. “The Venue is a team based at a growth point and all our players are from surrounding rural areas. Our objective is to empower these youngsters from Matobo and surrounding districts through sport and I for one am a passionate person when it comes to sport,” said Ndlovu. She said it was always her dream to see the team being promoted and she is aware that this now means more expenses to keep the club afloat. “Having an elite team in the community will help keep youngsters out of mischief and bring some sort of responsibility among young people as they will have a purpose and something feasible to look forward to the next day. The team neither intends to stay in the First Division for long nor get relegated to lower leagues, but we intend to advance to the Premiership,” she said. Ndlovu said if the team is supported and wins promotion to the Premiership, it will also bring infrastructural development to the community. “My appeal is for people from Matobo to rise up and rally behind their team. Tsholotsho FC once did it, being supported by the community and it is high time we emulate them and do something of our own,” said Ndlovu. — @DecoDecent2
