The Chronicle Response to “MDC-A youths threaten violence”. I remember Nelson Chamisa referring to his violent supporters as fools. Indeed they are and they keep proving him right. The sad thing is they are getting their lessons from Chamisa himself making it a perfect example of internal decay. – Masa33. Response to “Black market can’t determine forex rates”. Maybe someone must remind Tendai Biti that when he sits as chairman of a Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, he must cease to be an MDC-A operative. He becomes a representative of Zimbabweans and must see issues through national lenses. Thank you Mangudya for reminding this pseudo-economist cum phony financial guru that it is Parliament’s role to design and develop laws that govern activities by the citizens and institutions in the country. Rather than ask Mangudya about street rates and all that nonsense, he as part of a sitting legislative assembly should be telling Mangudya what he and his colleagues are crafting in order to rid the country of illegal money market operations . It is embarrassing to note that a whole Parliament would give chairmanship of such a key committee to a person who is not only an unstable character but is a quality ignoramus in money matters. Mangudya has been giving him lectures regarding fiscal matters as the questioning continues. – Masaisayi.
