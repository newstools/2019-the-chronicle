A GWANDA based businesswoman has been arrested after she allegedly threatened to shoot a group of mine workers before stealing mining equipment worth $3 760 and $200 cash. Siboniso Sayi (40), who owns Mosental Mine 16 in Filabusi, was not asked to plead when she appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Mrs Nomagugu Ncube, facing an armed robbery charge. She was remanded out of custody to February 26 on $100 bail. Prosecuting, Mr Takunda Mafudze said Sayi went to a neighbouring mine armed with a 12 bore Beretta rifle in the company of about 15 men on November 11 last year. “On November 11 last year, Sayi arrived in a truck at Mosental Mine A which is owned by Mr Ranias Gambiza in the company of about 15 men. She was armed with a 12 bore berret rifle. They found three mine workers Mr Taimani Munenge, Mr Edmore Muleya and Mr Saturday Mudenda warming themselves around a fire. “Without saying a word to the mine workers, Sayi ordered her crew to load equipment which comprised a hoist, mining tools, blankets, clothing, groceries and kitchen utensils valued at $3 760 into a truck. She also took $200 cash. The three mine workers approached Sayi in a bid to stop her from taking the property but she cocked her rifle and threatened to shoot anyone who tried to stop her,’’ he said. Mr Mafudze said the trio retreated out of fear of being shot and allowed Sayi to continue loading the property. Mr Muleya called his employer, Mr Gambiza and informed him about what Sayi was doing. Mr Gambiza advised his workers to avoid confronting Sayi as they could be shot. Mr Mafudze said Mr Gambiza reported the matter to the police on the following day resulting in Sayi’s arrest. He said the stolen property was not recovered. —@DubeMatutu
