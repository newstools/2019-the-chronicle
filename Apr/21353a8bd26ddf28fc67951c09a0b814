The Chronicle Locadia Mavhudzi, Midlands Correspondent GOVERNMENT has started distributing inputs to registered farmers in preparation for winter wheat cropping in the Midlands Province under the Command Wheat Programme. Provincial crop and livestock officer, Mrs Madeline Magwenzi said they had already started distributing fuel, seed, fertiliser and chemicals to farmers and that they were targeting 2 500 hectares. “We are now focusing on the distribution of inputs to our winter wheat farmers. Government has availed fuel, fertiliser, chemicals and seeds in time for the planting season,” she said. “The distribution exercise is being done concurrently with farmer training on effective ways to improve productivity. We are targeting 2500 hectares and encouraging farmers to plant early.” Mrs Magwenzi said they were targeting large commercial farmers and those with irrigation facilities in areas such as Gweru, Kwekwe and Shurugwi to improve their tonnage per hectare. “Increasing capacity for our farmers is imperative as we now have to do away with importing wheat all the time. We are targeting to give maximum support to farmers with irrigation facilities so that we continue to boost yields,” she said. Government has said it would not contract farmers who have failed to clear their debts from last season. The deadline for winter wheat planting is May 15. Turning to the summer cropping season, Mrs Magwenzi said the province has been severely affected by a long dry spell and the fall army worm. “We have had a poor season and our latest crop assessment report indicates that districts such as Gokwe and Mberengwa are in a dire situation and require urgent food aid while all the other districts experienced very low productivity. Poor rainfall activity coupled with fall army worm outbreaks were the major setbacks. “We have already submitted our crop assessment report to the minister and full details will be unveiled soon,” she said.
