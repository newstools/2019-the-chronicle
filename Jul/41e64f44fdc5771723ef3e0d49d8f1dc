The Chronicle Cape Town — Barcelona midfielder  Philippe Coutinho’s agent says that  ‘Liverpool lies very deeply in his heart’, fuelling speculation that the Brazilian might rejoin Liverpool. Coutinho left Liverpool for Barcelona under a cloud after he pushed for a move away from Anfield, but the move has not gone to plan and he has struggled for action. There has been talk of a return to Liverpool or even Manchester United or Chelsea, but his agent Kia Joorabchian says a move to the latter two is unlikely. He has also said Barca have no intention of selling anyway, meaning a return to Liverpool is also off the agenda for now. “We had a meeting last week with the president [Josep] Bartomeu and other directors, and they told us he was absolutely not for sale,” he said. “I think Liverpool lies very, very deeply in his heart. “He was a big fan of them throughout the campaign. “He was wishing for them to win the title and he has a very strong affinity there so I think it will be very difficult for him to go to a direct competitor of Liverpool from a personal standpoint.” — Sport24
