The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma FOR Gweru food lovers, the much-awaited Chicken Hut, a Portuguese restaurant, has opened its branch in the city with affordable prices. This is the fast food outlet’s fourth branch in the country after the Joina City, Avondale (Harare) and Kwekwe branches. The restaurant offers grilled chicken and chicken burgers among other mouth-watering meals. Chicken Hut spokesperson Tryphina Ndlovu said the Gweru lifestyle brand, which is located at the new Megawatt Complex (along Harare-Bulawayo Road), would be officially launched next month. She said they were targeting to open 10 branches at Puma fuel service stations across the country by year end. Through their Heart Initiative, Ndlovu said Chicken Hut will be paying fees for 10 students from Midlands State University (MSU) with talks with the institution at an advanced stage. “We’re awaiting approval from the MSU vice chancellor as we want to pay fees for 10 disabled and disadvantaged students and also cater for their personal needs,” she said. —@mthabisi_mthire
