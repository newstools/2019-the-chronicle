The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma Stand-up gospel comedian Thubelihle “Nceku” Sibanda has relocated to South Africa in a move to broaden his scope in the arts industry. After a sterling performance at renowned gospel artiste, Dr Tumi’s “Gathering of Worshippers Gospel Concert” in Pretoria last year, the comedian-cum-musician has been warmly welcomed in Mzansi. Nceku’s communications officer, Wisdom Nyathi, said the artiste decided to join his counterpart, comedian Q Dube in the search for greener pastures. “Nceku’s move to South Africa was meant to get him closer to the action as he was getting bookings at concerts, weddings and other corporate events in South Africa,” said Nyathi. Asked how the move has been, Nceku said it has not been that easy as he has to meet the standards of renowned comedians. “Moving from a comfort zone is never easy, but it was an exciting challenge to tackle a new ground. The courage came from my past performances in SA.” Added Nyathi: “A whole new refreshed, revived and refuelled Nceku is on the way. February was a month of settling, planning and strategising but from now on, people should expect to see Nceku alongside prominent people in the industry.” Despite relocating to South Africa, Nceku will fulfil his bookings in Zimbabwe. “I’ll fulfil the bookings I have in Zimbabwe and will continue to deliver pure, clean, motivational comedy that gives life lessons. I’ll also prepare a fresh dish of comedy that they’re not familiar with,” he said. Nceku urged local comedians to “follow their dreams despite what the next person says. Only you knows the burning fire inside your heart. “Research, connect, work hard and improve your skill into a valuable brand that cannot be ignored.” — @mthabisi_mthire.
