The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter ZIMBABWE has in the first two months of the year produced 3,91 tonnes of gold with small-scale miners producing the bulk of the mineral at 2,53 tonnes of the yellow metal. Statistics from the country’s sole gold buyer, Fidelity Printers and Refiners, also indicate that gold output in the last month shot to a congregated figure of 2,14 tonnes from a total of 1,77 tonnes delivered by both primary producers and small-scale miners. Of the 2,14 tonnes delivered to Fidelity Printers and Refiners in February, 1,5 tonnes came from small-scale miners while 0,64 tonnes was from large mining companies. The statistics also show that in January, small-scale miners led in gold deliveries producing 1,03 tonnes while primary producers delivered 0,75 tonnes. Zimbabwe Miners’ Federation (ZMF) spokesperson Mr Dosman Mangisi said the year has started on a low note compared to 2018, which saw the country producing 33 tonnes with 22 tonnes coming from small-scale miners. Of late, the decline in gold output has been attributed to the prevailing macro-economic situation characterised by fuel challenges. “Gold sales have shown a positive response with an increase in the month of February of 370 kilogrammes putting the total figure to 2,14 tonnes from 1,77 tonnes produced in January. We project more gold output this year,” he said. Mr Mangisi urged the Government to come up with more user-friendly policies and regulations as well as mechanising small-scale miners. In most instances, it has been observed that despite topping in gold production, small-scale miners were predominantly operating with traditional tools such as picks and shovels unlike their large-scale counterparts who have sophisticated and modern equipment. The country holds the second largest gold reserves per square kilometre in the whole world with an estimated 13 million tonnes of gold underground. — @okazunga.
