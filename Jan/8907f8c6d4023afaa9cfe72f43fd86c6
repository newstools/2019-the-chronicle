The Chronicle Munich — Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund resume their Bundesliga rivalry this weekend with both sides looking to avoid slipping up in the title race at home against relegation-threatened opposition. Dortmund, who are six points clear of defending champions Bayern, host second-from-bottom Hanover today while VfB Stuttgart, who are 16th and also in the bottom-three, are Sunday’s guests at Munich’s Allianz Arena and are hoping to avoid a fourth straight league defeat. Bayern coach Niko Kovac has a decision to make about who starts at centre-back for second-placed Bayern with neither 2014 World Cup winners Jerome Boateng nor Mats Hummels, both 30, sure of a starting place. Kovac has said Niklas Suele is the only centre-back sure of a spot in the 11, leaving the experienced Germany stars to battle for the other berth. Hummels started last Friday’s 3-1 win at Hoffenheim, with Boateng on the bench, because “Mats was just a tiny bit better — we’re talking a micron” explained Kovac. The race is on to see who can convince Kovac they should start Bayern’s Champions League last 16 away tie at Anfield on February 19. Bayern are searching for clues as to why they lag behind Dortmund and midfielder Leon Goretzka has revealed they are attempting to find their weaknesses.
