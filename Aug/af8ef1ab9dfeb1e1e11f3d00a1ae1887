The Chronicle Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) yesterday announced an increase in the price of fuel, with cities having different prices ranging from $10.01 to $10.56 for petrol and $10.32 to $10.86 for diesel. According to the price list released by the authority, motorists in Matabeleland will buy fuel at higher prices than those in other provinces. The increase comes a week after the authority reviewed fuel prices to $9.36 for diesel up from $9.27 while petrol went up to $9.12 from $9.09. “Please be advised that there are new fuel prices according to cities with effect from Monday August 26, 2019. “The petroleum prices applicable in the various cities represent the maximum pump prices taking into account the transport costs,” read a statement from Zera. The most expensive is Victoria Falls at $10.56 for petrol and $10.86 for diesel and Hwange, which will sell petrol at $10.52 and diesel at $10.82, while Beitbridge and Plumtree will sell petrol at $10.43 and diesel at $10.74.

In Nyanga, Rusape and Chinhoyi petrol will be sold for $10.14 and diesel will be sold for $10.44 while the cheapest prices are in Harare and Mutare with petrol going for $10.01 and diesel for $10.32. “Operators may, however, sell at prices below the cap depending on their trading advantages,” read the Zera statement. It is indicated in the statement that the increases are a result of the movement in the foreign currency exchange rates and the Free On Board (FOB) price and the revised duty regime (SI 161 of 2019). — @pamelashumba1.
