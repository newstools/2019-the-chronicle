President Mnangagwa is expected to attend a breakfast prayer meeting today in the city organised by churches that are seeking divine intervention to end the challenges facing the country. Speaking after the Zanu-PF’s 325th Ordinary Session of the Politburo yesterday, the party’s secretary for administration, Cde Obert Mpofu, said the prayer meeting was in sync with President Mnangagwa’s clarion call for peace and unity in the country. “This echoes well with the President’s call for national dialogue to foster peace, security and social cohesion in the country,” he said. Cde Mpofu said the meeting, which was a continuation of last week’s Politburo meeting, also deliberated on party programmes that would be rolled out nationwide. The programmes, he said were meant to support the Government’s thrust to turn the country into an upper middle income economy by 2030. “Our meeting today was a continuation of last week’s Politburo meeting. Today we further discussed party programmes for this year,” he said. Cde Mpofu said the meeting also resolved to strengthen the party structures as part of building towards the 2023 harmonised elections. “The meeting consensually directed 2019 as the year of strengthening the party from cell, branch, district and provincial levels and vigorously start working hard as we build towards the 2023 elections,” he said. Cde Mpofu said the party also discussed drought relief issues in view of the semi-normal rains being experienced in the country. “The party is positioned to ameliorate challenges the country is facing in provinces where the rain pattern is not favourable,” he said. The party, he said, agreed that no one would starve as a result of drought and Government is seeking to establish the extent of drought around the country.
