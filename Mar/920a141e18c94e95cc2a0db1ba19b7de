The Chronicle Business Reporter ECONET Zimbabwe group of companies have collectively contributed RTGS$5 million towards Cyclone Idai emergency efforts in the eastern parts of the country. The company has channelled the funds to Higherlife Foundation, which is embedded in efforts to respond to the crisis induced by the natural disaster. The cyclone has left 98 people dead and thousands displaced. Dr Kennedy Mubaiwa, who heads the foundation, said they were mobilising various types of support, including rescue efforts, medical emergency aid, food, water and blankets. Econet Wireless Zimbabwe chief executive officer, Mr Douglas Mboweni, said each company in the group was pursuing co-ordinated initiatives based on its own capabilities. “We are not just providing money but we want all our staff of more than 5 000 to help in some way, using their skills,” he said. EcoSure, the group’s funeral insurance company, was providing free assistance with funeral services such as coffins, transport and food to each bereaved family with no cover, said Mr Mboweni. He also said Mutare Bottling had opened its warehouses to allow logistics support for humanitarian aid coming from Econet subscribers, adding that MARS Ambulance was also providing ambulances, air and helicopter support. Meanwhile, Mr Mboweni said Econet subscribers had responded overwhelmingly to calls for donations in cash and kind. He said Econet shops had been receiving blankets, water bottles, dried foods, and medicines.
