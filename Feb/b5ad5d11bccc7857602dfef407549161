UMGUZA district is facing a challenge with girls under scholarships who fail to complete school due to pregnancies. Umguza deputy district administrator Ms Sikhangele Ndlovu said this development puts the area in bad light and sponsors end up withdrawing funds after the girls drop out. Speaking during a Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education community awareness programme in Bulawayo yesterday, Ms Ndlovu called on the community to find ways of curbing teenage pregnancies. “We have numerous stakeholders that have pledged to help children especially girls who cannot access school for different reasons. However, we have a serious challenge of girls who get sponsors and then fail to complete their education after they fall pregnant,” said Ms Ndlovu. “We have organisations like Campaign for Female Education (Camfed) which are on the lookout for needy girls but teenage pregnancies are hindering progress,” she said. Ms Ndlovu urged communities to embrace programmes created to ensure all children access quality and inclusive education despite prevailing circumstances. Imbizo District Schools Inspector Mr Misheck Ngwenya urged members of the public to ensure all children have access to inclusive education. “We are here to emphasise the fact that all children must access education despite economic and physical challenges. We are aware that there are communities that still keep children at home because they have disabilities or because they are orphaned and vulnerable,” said Mr Ngwenya. —@thamamoe
