The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter AFRO-Pop musician Mzoe 7 and rapper POY have promised to stage a great show when they perform alongside Zimdancehall musicians Seh Calaz, Jah Signal and Hwindi President this Friday at The Vista. Mzoe 7 said he would use the event to release his new track titled Elliot that was inspired by a man who was allegedly resurrected by Pastor Lukau in South Africa. “As always, people should expect a highly energetic performance from me that will be coupled with new dance moves. I’ll also be launching my new song titled Elliot which was inspired by the bogus resurrection,” said Mzoe 7. “The song is meant to urge people to trust in God more than humans. Many fake pastors are stealing money from unsuspecting people and it’s my duty to inform and empower them through my music.” POY said he would love to collaborate with one of the Zimdancehall musicians that will be performing on the night. “I admire what the Zimdancehall musicians have been doing and how they push their music so I really hope to grab the opportunity and try to work with one of the three Zimdancehall musicians that’ll be here,” POY said. He added that he will also be performing new music. “People should expect a great performance from me and my dancers – the Whine Queens.”
