The Chronicle Nduduzo Tshuma, Political Editor THE Zanu-PF observer mission has castigated attempts to discredit the South African national elections in the wake of claims of double voting with some videos circulating on social media of some people committing the mischief. South Africans cast their votes in the country’s national elections on Wednesday. South African police on Thursday arrested 20 people in KwaZulu Natal over double voting with some political parties threatening to approach the courts to nullify the polls over the alleged incident. The IEC on Thursday said it would conduct an audit to determine the impact of the reported double voting incident on the election. Yesterday, the electoral body said there was no evidence of double voting. In an interview with a South African television station, Zanu-PF secretary for business liaison Cde Sithembiso Nyoni said the incidents were too few to affect the poll outcome while the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) was well equipped to trace those double voters. Cde Nyoni is part of the 11-member observer mission, chaired by Cde Patrick Chinamasa, dispatched by President  Mnangagwa to observe the South African polls. They broke into three teams led by Cdes Chinamasa, Nyoni and Simon Khaya Moyo respectively. In the interview, Cde Nyoni said allegations of electoral irregularities will always be there, the commission has confidence in the capacity of the IEC in addressing the concerns. “We visited about 20 polling stations and we were very careful in terms of how the elections were being run. These allegations will always be there but the important thing is, according to what we saw, it is possible to trace who has voted twice because your system is tight.”
