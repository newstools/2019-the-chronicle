The Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces will interface with the war collaborators to discuss, among other issues, their welfare. President Mnangagwa will also interface with Zanu-PF party supporters in the Midlands at the open space adjacent to the Convention Centre.

Eng Ncube said the party was expecting close to 10 000 people to attend both the conference and the rally. “We are expecting President Mnangagwa to address members of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Collaborators’ Association who are having their annual conference at the Zanu-PF Convention Centre. “President Mnangagwa will also address party supporters at the open space near the Convention Centre,” he said. Eng Ncube said the party had already facilitated logistical issues to ensure that the two events are flawless. “We have already made arrangements on how the people who are coming to the rally are travelling,” he said.
