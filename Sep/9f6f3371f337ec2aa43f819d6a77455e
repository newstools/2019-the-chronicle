The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter Highlanders 0-0 Mushowani Stars HIGHLANDERS  coach Mandla Mpofu professed ignorance over the three-game ultimatum given to him by the club, saying he will soldier on to turn Bosso’s fortunes around and steer the team from relegation. Mpofu and his technical team have fallen short of the six-point target from three games as they were beaten 2-1 by Triangle United and drew 0-0 against lowly Mushowani Stars yesterday. They head to Hwange for the third game, meaning that should they beat the coalminers, Mpofu and his technical team would have collected only four points. Yesterday he watched his charges squander numerous scoring opportunities in both halves and said a point against Mushowani Stars was a step in the right direction after three consecutive defeats to Caps United, Harare City and Triangle. “We are always playing catch-up and I think we will accept the draw because we had lost three games on the trot. We will keep fighting,” said Mpofu. “About the ultimatum, football is a pressure sport and every institution has set targets. It’s unfortunate that we find ourselves in a difficult position where we can collect four points instead of six for the three-game period under review. “There was no ultimatum or letter given to the coaches, but it was just a meeting between the executive and the coaches where we said, look, let’s go for six points and review after three games. “The games are getting fewer and fewer and we need to collect as many points as possible,” he said. As usual, Bosso dominated their opponents, forcing them to defend in their half but failed to convert the chances they created. Twice, midfielder Brian Banda tried long-range shots which were well dealt with by an alert Mushowani Stars goalkeeper, Admire Masuku. Tinashe Makanda, Nqobizitha Masuku and Ray Lunga also watched their attempts going agonisingly wide. Mushowani Stars came out of their slumber in the second half and played a good passing game. They had their first attempt on goal just after the hour-mark when Amon Kambanje’s snap-shot went through a cluster of legs before being saved by goalkeeper, Ariel Sibanda. Had they been patient in the final third, Mushowani Stars could have stolen three points. Newman Mashipe, the Mushowani Stars coach, was happy with the point. “The guys showed character and after defending deep in the first half, I told the boys to settle down and play our normal passing game. That is when we started creating chances. “When we came for this game, I just psyched the players, told them look, we are going to Highlanders who have been losing and are in the same position as we are so let’s go and fight,” said Mashipe.
