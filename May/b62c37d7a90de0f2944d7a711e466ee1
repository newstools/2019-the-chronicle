Police went to the college to investigate and they found lessons underway. They requested to see the person in charge and they were referred to Mkhokheli Ndlovu,” she said. Miss Mutukwa said the detectives requested to see a certificate of registration for the college but Ndlovu failed to produce one resulting in his arrest.
