BAC tackle log leaders Emakhandeni in a League 1 Bulawayo Cricket League match at Queens Sports Club on Saturday. Both teams face each other following good outings last week during which they recorded good wins. BAC overcame Queens Cricket Club and Emakhandeni dismissed Roosters last weekend. BAC have been on a roll since resumption of the league after the season’s break and their captain Flemming Nkomo said playing against Emakhandeni will give them a real test. “We’re looking forward to the game because if we beat them (Emakhandeni), it means we’re back in the title race. Last week we played well to beat Queens and that result gave us a lot of confidence,” said Nkomo. In another match, Queens will play Roosters at BAC. In League 2, Nust come up against Tigers, while Lupane will square off with Gampu Lions at the Heath Streak Cricket Academy and Queens Sports Club respectively. BAC 2 will host Champions in a League 2 game before Bulawayo Polytechnic play against Cheetahs at the same venue.
