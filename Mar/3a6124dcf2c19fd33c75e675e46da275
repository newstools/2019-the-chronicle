ZIMDANCEHALL chanter Freeman will be returning to Bulawayo this Saturday for a performance at Cosmopolitan Night Club. He will be in Victoria Falls tomorrow where he is billed to perform at Comfort Pub and Grill. Popularly known as HKD Boss, Freeman who featured on ExQ’s Nzenza hit, said he was looking forward to the Bulawayo and Victoria Falls shows. “It’s not every day that I perform in places like Bulawayo and Victoria Falls since it’s far and as such whenever I come to those places, I make sure that I impress my fans,” he said. Freeman said he will be dropping a new song next week which will be accompanied by a video. “I’ve done a collaboration with a UK-based Afro-pop artiste called Lamont Chitepo. The song is called Vuka Vuka and will be released next week,” said Freeman. The Zimdancehall chanter who admires Bulawayo Hip Hop musician Cal_Vin, said he would love to collaborate with him and hopes to meet him during his visit on Saturday. The Rangarira hit-maker will be backed by Cosmopolitan resident DJs Mzoe, Keezy AM and Kead Wikead.
