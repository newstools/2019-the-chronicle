The Chronicle Editor – Over the past couple of weeks, the Bulawayo city council and its contractors have been resurfacing and painting Bulawayo roads, not only for the ZITF but also beyond this event. This has been a commendable and successful project. As a motorist and on behalf of the public we would love to thank them for the job done thus far. The roads are much smoother and good for travelling on. In the process, they have helped sustain our vehicles tyres’ endurance. Most vehicles won’t be having easy wear down they were having like before. Before this project, the roads were in a horrible state, bumpy and with a lot of potholes. It felt as though we were driving on dust roads. This is a great project and development in our city and country, considering we are a third world country. Let’s hope they can keep up the good job. And restore Bulawayo roads to their status of being one of the best roads in Southern Africa. On behalf of the public, we would urge the City Fathers to take this project of road surfacing to the western suburbs, where the majority of the population live. They travel by road on a daily basis, twice as much as those in the eastern suburbs do, thus the need for road surfacing in those areas. Motorists like me who travel up and down Bulawayo on a daily basis have noticed that most roads in certain eastern suburbs (Ilanda, Bradfield etc.) receive more attention than other areas.
