FORMER Highlanders captain Honest Moyo is now turning out for TS Sporting in the South African National First Division League after dumping the Bulawayo giants. Moyo, a Highlanders junior product, left as a free agent and his whereabouts have been mired in uncertainty as even Bosso were not in the picture of where he was now playing even though they were strong suspicions that he was in South Africa. “I am now on the books of TS Sporting who are playing in Division One here in South Africa,” said the left footed Moyo who had previously been linked with a move to Absa Premiership giants Orlando Pirates after a stellar performance in national team colours during the 2017 Cosafa Cup in South Africa. Asked whether he was enjoying life there, Moyo had this to say: “Yes, kuyaphileka.” He is however, yet to make his NFD debut. “My International Reverse Certificate had not yet arrived but it’s finally here now so I’m looking forward to making my debut for the club,” said the former Luveve High School pupil. TS Sporting are ninth on the NFD table, 17 points behind runaway leaders Stellenbosch from the same number of games, 22 and seem more concerned about fighting relegation than the league title even though it’s their maiden season in the second tier league of South African football. Moyo joins fellow Highlanders players King Nadolo and Cleopas Dube in Division One of South African football. Nadolo and Dube turn out for Witbank Spurs, who are firm relegation candidates as they lie second from the bottom with a paltry 21 points from 22 matches.
