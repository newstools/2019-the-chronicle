Response to “Economy will improve”
If we keep on working together the economy will definitely improve. Our Government is determined to make things better for everyone. We have already witnessed the return of Zupco and housing projects for civil servants. A little patience from everyone and support is necessary. Unity is also very crucial at this stage. We have to do away with demonstrations that destroy property worth millions. — Tanaka. Response to “Four die in Kombi accident”
May their souls rest in peace, all the reason why we applaud the idea of buses. — Charlie C Response to “Maid (40) infects employer’s son (10) with HIV”
