The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent IMBUBE outfit Indosakusa: The Morning Star, which is celebrating 18 years in the music industry, will be taking the festivities to Gwanda, a place where they formed the group and last performed 13 years ago. The group, which was formally known as Impumelelo Shining Stars, was formed in 2001 and rebranded to Indosakusa: The Morning Star last year. The celebrations in Gwanda will be held on Saturday at Mapane Primary School with the likes of Gaz’elimnyama, Sis Thoe, Umkhankaso Wamajaha, Bhamuza, Sisters of Paradise, Innocent Nyoni and Bulawayo African Stars billed to perform. Entry will be free. Indosakusa lead singer Oscar Siziba said: “We formed our group in Gwanda in 2001 before relocating to Bulawayo. Celebrating 18 years in the industry in Gwanda will be special to us and the fans there as they are the ones who supported and helped nurture our talent.” He encouraged all imbube music lovers to come out in their numbers to celebrate with them. “We urge fans to come and support us on Saturday. We’ve made a provision for transport for those who want to travel from Bulawayo. It’ll cost just RTGS$15 and the transport will leave the National Gallery at 6.45AM,” said Siziba. Indosakusa launched their 11th album Gospel Volume 2: Siyadumisa last month and attracted a full house at the Bulawayo Theatre. The show was organised by the group’s fans.
