AWARD-winning hip hop musician, Takura, of the Mai Mwana fame is set to serenade lovers in Bulawayo with a romantic performance at Cosmopolitan Nightclub on Saturday. The Valentine’s Day special show dubbed “Cupids Night” will also serve as a celebration of the rapper’s victory at the recently held Star FM Music Awards where he clinched the Best RnB Song for hit Can’t Get Over You. The artiste, who is expected in the city on Saturday afternoon, is the man behind love songs Mai Mwana and Mhofu. His manager Michael Mangondoza said Takura was raised in Bulawayo and was definitely looking forward to performing here. “Takura loves his Bulawayo fans since he grew up there. He’s advising them to prepare to witness the definition of ‘kusetter pace’ (setting the pace).” On the artiste’s plans for this year, his manager said: “Takura wants to reintroduce Zimbabwe music to a global audience. As such, his fans should expect high quality productions and collaborations.” He added that the artiste would be releasing a lot of music this year as he is planning to get out of his comfort zone and try out a lot of different genres. Takura, who recently dropped a video for his song Noise which is trending online, recently took to social media to share how his life has changed from being a garden boy to being a successful musician. “When I tell people I was a garden boy, so many people start opening up saying they never thought a person like me was a garden boy. My advice to people is ‘just be yourself and it will definitely work out for you because you’ll inspire people,” Takura said. The organiser of the Bulawayo Cupids show, Terminator Makoni, said preparations for the lovers show were going on well. “This will be one special romantic night not to be missed,” said Terminator. Cosmopolitan resident DJs Kead Wikead, Keezy AM and Mzoe will be on the decks with the cheapest ticket pegged at $5.
