A 19-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo’s Entumbane suburb who fatally stabbed his brother following a misunderstanding over a radio yesterday appeared in court and was remanded in custody to January 22. Henry Hungwe, a mental patient, stabbed Kudakwashe Hungwe (26) on Sunday morning at their parents’ house. Hungwe appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube and was remanded in custody to January 22. Prosecutor Mr Kenneth Shava said Hungwe was remanded in custody because the matter involved family parties and chances are the accused might disappear. “In addition, the medical cards held indicate that the accused person is a mental patient and as such he can commit a similar offence,” he said. The court heard that the incident happened at around 10AM. It is the state’s case that Hungwe was repairing a radio in the sitting room when Kudakwashe ordered him to leave the room. “There was a misunderstanding, Kudakwashe took away the radio from Henry and went to the kitchen. Henry followed him and violently took back the radio and smashed it on the floor. The younger brother took a kitchen knife which he was using as a screw driver and stabbed Kudakwashe on the left side of the chest near the armpit,” said Mr Shava. “Kudakwashe called their tenant, who with the assistance of the siblings’ mother rushed him to Mpilo Central Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.” — @LissahMangena.
