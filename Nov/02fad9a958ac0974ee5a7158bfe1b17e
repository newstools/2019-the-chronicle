The Chronicle War crimes allegedly carried out by the British military may for the first time be investigated by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Killings of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq have been covered up by the state, a BBC news programme reported yesterday. But children were killed, civilians tortured, and British troops were complicit with evidence reportedly contained in a series of leaked documents sourced from within the Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT). That team, and Operation Northmoor – which investigated war crime allegations in Afghanistan – were shut down by the UK government in 2017 after Phil Shiner, a solicitor who had taken more than 1 000 cases to IHAT, was struck off from practising law amid allegations he paid people in Iraq to find clients. But some former investigators said Shiner’s actions were used as an excuse to close down the inquiries. No case investigated by IHAT or Operation Northmoor has led to a prosecution. The ICC said it has taken the accusations “very seriously”, according to the BBC.—Al Jazeera.
