The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent A TEENAGER from Old Pumula suburb in Bulawayo who was stabbed to death in an incident that left his friend hospitalised, was part of a syndicate of armed robbers who turned on each other after rowing about how to share their loot. Thabelo Ndlovu (19) allegedly stabbed Mthokozisi Phakathi (19) to death  and left their friend Blessed Zulu in a critical condition following a dispute over a cellphone and money on Monday last week.
