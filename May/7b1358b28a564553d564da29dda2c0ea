The Chronicle An outbreak of fleas has led to the closure of a Paris police station after officers complained they were being bitten and the parasites were “contaminating” their homes. A police union said officials had not properly dealt with the outbreak – which reportedly began a few weeks ago – and that working conditions were deplorable. Their demand to shut the police station for a complete disinfection has now been heeded. Le Parisien reports that pest control experts will enter the building on Monday and Tuesday to kill off the fleas. Many staff at the station – in the city’s 19th arrondissement – had been bitten and the police union said some had “brought back (the fleas) to their homes thus contaminating the family unit”. Union officials said they would raise the issue during a meeting with interior minister Christophe Castaner on Monday. – AP
