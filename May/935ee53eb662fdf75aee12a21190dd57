Barring the exorbitant charges, revellers are assured to get value for their money as the three artistes rarely disappoint every time they are given a platform to perform. This will be the trio’s first performance in Masvingo since the beginning of the year with Winky D having last performed at the same venue with the late Oliver Mtukudzi in October last year. Fans who spoke to Chronicle Showbiz said they were looking forward to the show.– @walterbmswazie2
