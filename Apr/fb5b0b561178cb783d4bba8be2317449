The Chronicle Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter THE manufacturing sector has expressed readiness to increase production and achieve the targeted 25 percent contribution to the Gross Domestic Product by 2030 from 10 percent. Revitalising the manufacturing sector is at the heart of the country’s Transitional stabilisation Programme (TSP) and the drive to expand the job market. In an interview last week, newly elected president of the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) Matabeleland Chapter, Mr Shepherd Chawira, who is chief executive for Shepco Group, said industry was geared to play its part in the economy given all the adequate support. “We appreciate that Government through the TSP wants industry to contribute 25 percent to the Gross Domestic Product. That number is very achievable provided that the Government also plays its part in terms of the challenges that industry is facing,” he said. Mr Chawira said CZI would continue engaging Government towards tackling inherent bottlenecks stifling industry growth. He said the implementation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) was critical for Bulawayo.—@okazunga
