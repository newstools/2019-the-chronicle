The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter SEVEN messenger of court   agents have been arrested for allegedly breaking into a man’s house and stealing P28 000. The seven were effecting an eviction order against the man from the house. Michael Dayo (46), Dambudzo Mabhandi (39), Hlabangani Nyoni (39), Steven Ndlovu (43), Nhlanhla Ndlovu (50), Thomas Ndebele (50) and Gift Sibanda (44) allegedly stole from Mr Proud Chivero (43). The men were not asked to plead to theft charges when they appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Ulukile Mlea-Ndlovu. The magistrate remanded them out of custody on $100 bail each to October 4. Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said on September 20 this year, the men went to Mr Chivero’s house in Suburbs in his absence. “The accused persons forced open a locked bedroom door where they took the money which was in the wardrobe,” he said. The prosecutor said Mr Chivero, who had received information about the presence of the agents, rushed to his house and found some of his property already loaded into the messenger of court’s truck. “The complainant confronted the accused persons about the missing money and asked them to wait for the police,” Mr Dlodlo said. The messengers allegedly threatened Mr Chivero who locked himself in one of the rooms for safety. Mr Chivero reported the matter to the police leading to the accused persons’ arrest. The stolen money was not recovered. — @zinyuke98
