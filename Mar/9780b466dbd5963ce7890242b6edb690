The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter A community netball team from Hwange, Lusumbami Queens, has assembled a strong side for this year’s Glow Petroleum Rainbow Amateur Netball League (RANL) season. Lusumbami Queens president Thembinkosi Muremba said the club has ambitions of remaining in the topflight netball league after six years in the Southern Region Division One league since their formation in February 2012. “We’re affectionately known as Lusu-Lusu Queens by our supporters and we promise to challenge for honours. With the guidance of one of the most experienced coaches in Zimbabwe, Janota Aphiri, the team has already made its supporters happy and will make them even happier this season,” said Muremba. He said the coach has all the support from team manager Marita Mwenelupembe, who is the team’s former player. “It is good for the club that I sit on the RANL national executive because of the passion I have for netball, but the club lacks sponsorship. It relies on donations from well wishers around the community, which makes it difficult for survival, particularly to fulfill away fixtures,” he said.. — @DecoDecent2
