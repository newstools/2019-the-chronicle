Internationally-acclaimed Barcelos restaurant is set to invest $350 000 in opening a second branch in Bulawayo. The restaurant boasts of three outlets in the country and is set to open more this year. Last year, the restaurant opened two outlets in Harare. In an interview, the company director Mr Benson Muneri said the Bulawayo outlet was the busiest in terms of turnover and opening another branch in the city was a way of thanking the local people. “We are still going to do another Central Business District store in Bulawayo. The demand has been extremely positive in terms of customer feedback and support. Bulawayo probably is the busiest Barcelos restaurant worldwide in terms of turnover. “In the next two months, we are planning to open a second store in Bulawayo. The second Bulawayo store we’re looking at investing $350 000 that will in turn employ 35 to 40 people. “All in all, we’re looking at investing $4,5 million in Zimbabwe in the next 12 months,” said Mr Muneri. He said by mid-year they were eyeing to open other branches in Gweru, Kwekwe, Kadoma and Rusape. Mr Muneri said despite the economic challenges in the country they have maintained their prices and were still accepting all forms of payment. “The economy is not performing well but it’s a passing phase. Despite the challenges in the country, we have not increased our prices and we accept all forms of payment could it be EcoCash, swipe and bond currency. “We can’t charge in foreign currency when people are paid in local currency,” he said. — @Kiyaz_Cool.
