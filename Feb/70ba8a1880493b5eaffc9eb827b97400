MATOBO Rural District Council (RDC) has threatened to repossess residential and commercial stands which have not been developed for over 11 years. In an interview, Matobo Rural District Council Chief Executive Officer Mr Elvis Sibanda said individuals who might be affected by the council’s decision should approach it before March 15. “Some of these applicants were allocated stands as far back as 2008. They managed to pay the deposit only and no development took place while others managed to dig trenches for foundation. We have lost track of some of the property owners,” he said. Mr Sibanda said the law empowers local authorities to repossess land if it is not developed over a certain period of time. He said council feels it is important to repossess the stands to accommodate land seekers who are on its waiting list. —@sharonbuwe
