These children do not know the love of a parent so I thought I should give them the little love that I have. I have always admired (Cde) Raj Modi, what he does for the poor and the helpless is amazing. I also want to be like him so this is my way of trying to measure up to him. In fact the drinks were provided by him and we thank him for his contribution,” she said. Mrs Dube-Nyevhe urged other business people to go out of their way to help the vulnerable. “If we all play our part Zimbabwe and Bulawayo will be a better place. Every donation, every gift, every sponsorship helps to eradicate poverty. So I call out all the people who can afford to give without ceasing,” she said.
