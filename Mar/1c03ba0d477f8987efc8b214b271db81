A 65-YEAR-OLD man from Shurugwi allegedly stabbed his wife leading to her death in hospital following a dispute over a missing spanner. Angeline Marecha (61) died upon admission to Shurugwi Hospital after Erifas Toziva viciously attacked her on Sunday. Midlands police spokesperson Inspector Joel Goko confirmed the arrest on Monday. “I can confirm that police in Shurugwi are investigating the death of a woman after she was stabbed by her husband over a missing spanner. The man has since been arrested and is assisting police with investigations,” said Insp Goko. Allegations are that on March 3, Toziva and his wife were at their homestead at Chemhere Village under Chief Nhema. “A misunderstanding arose over a missing spanner which had allegedly been borrowed by a neighbour but was yet to be returned. The misunderstanding degenerated into a fist fight,” he said. Insp Goko said during the exchange of blows, Toziva produced a knife and stabbed his wife once on the chest and vanished from the scene leaving her lying unconscious in a pool of blood. Marecha was rushed to Shurugwi Hospital where she died upon admission. Insp Goko said loss of life could have been avoided had the issue been resolved amicably. “We urge members of the public to solve matters amicably and avoid using violence. This loss of life could have been avoided had the family avoided use of violence”, he said. Insp Goko said police were concerned about the increasing cases of murder over trivial issues.
