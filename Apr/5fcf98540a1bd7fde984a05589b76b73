The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) has been left with just two teams under its umbrella after one of the only three remaining teams Ngezi Platinum decided to jump ship and join the Glow Petroleum funded Rainbow Amatuer Netball League. Zina, which runs the Super League, now has only Harare City Queens and Lupane State University under its control but indications are that the remaining two sides will eventually abandon the clearly sinking ship. “Ngezi Platinum have come on board but they have requested to start their league games next weekend,” said Ranl fixtures secretary Obert Njiri. Besides the Ngezi game, other teams will continue with their league matches today, with defending champions Correctional Services taking their campaign to Golden Valley where they will be looking forward to a successful trip this afternoon. They have so far played and won their opening two matches scoring 112 points. The pick of today’s matches is that between second placed Bulawayo Goldreef and third placed Zimbabwe Defence Forces Queens. Goldreef are on second spot by virtue of having conceded less points compared to their opponents who however have been ruthless in scoring, hitting the target an incredible 123 times in the two matches they played while Goldreef have 113. Another interesting match is in Zvishavane where Platinum Queens play host to Glow Petroleum at Bethany. It was not immediately clear though if players who are in camp in preparation for the Vitality World Cup will be released by the national association to participate in league games. Fixtures: Flow Angels v Falcons (Glenview 1 New Hall), Rio Zim v PPU (Rio Zim), Rhinos v Tenax (Morris Depot), Golden Valley v Correctional Services (Golden Valley), Platinum Queens v Glow Petroleum (Bethany), Goldreef v ZDF (Raylton or White City Stadium), Mutare City v Ruwa (Mutare), Beta Queens v Ngezi Platinum (postponed).
