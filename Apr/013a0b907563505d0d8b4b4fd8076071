THEY have managed to lure not less than half-a-dozen sponsors this year and former champions, Chicken Inn, are looking to ride on the financial stability in their quest to win the Castle Lager Premiership football title. The Gamecocks who host giants Dynamos at Barbourfields this Saturday, have had a brilliant start to their campaign after winning their opening two games. “The corporate world is now realising that football is business,’’ club secretary-general Tavengwa Hara said. “Sometimes, it’s not about the number of supporters but the business synergies that you can make and the value that comes out of it. “So, we have to make sure that we all get value from the partnerships. We must be disciplined as a team and everything else will follow as a bonus. “Apart from the sponsorship, we will also be quite happy as a club to export one or two players every year to earn some forex so that we don’t rely solely on sponsorship. “Above all, we would want to improve our position last season. We have been in the top four for a long time and it’s time we see some progress.’’ The Gamecocks recently signed new deals with Nyaradzo Group and ZLG. Nyaradzo will give funeral cover to 50 players and officials. The club will also get a team bus from Nyaradzo while ZLG will be their official drinking water supplier. ZLG will also pay one home camping per month. Hara said the club, which has largely been sponsored by Simbisa Brands since 2010 when they got promoted into the top-flight league, recognise that football is business. They managed to retain previous deals with Blackshark Protection Services, Zibuko Capital and Bonvie Medical Aid.
