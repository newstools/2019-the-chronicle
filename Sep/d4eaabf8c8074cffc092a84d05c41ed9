The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter A number of teams from outside Bulawayo are expected to take part in the inaugural Bulawayo Volleyball Association (BVA) Pre-Beach Volleyball Series slated for Busters Sports Club on Saturday. Participants from the BVA, schools, tertiary institutions and volleyball sportspersons in communities will square off in the women’s, men’s and mixed doubles categories. BVA vice-chairman Munya Chigudu said: “Activity has improved since yesterday in terms inquiries and registration. We urge schools, institutions and the community to come and play on a social and semi-professional platform in a bid to market the sport of beach volleyball.” Bulawayo is exposed to the more formal six-a-side version of volleyball, but beach volleyball is heading for greater heights both as a recreational sport and as a competitive discipline. Beach volleyball is mainly played in Harare where it took root after an exhibition at the Zimbabwe National Youth Games in Marondera in 2010. It’s played by two teams of two players each on a sand court divided by a net. As in indoor volleyball, the objective of the game is to send the ball over the net and to ground it on the opponent’s side of the court, and to prevent the same effort by the opponent. A team is allowed up to three touches to return the ball across the net, and individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively except after making a block touch. Registration is $30 if a pair is made up of school children, $40 if the pair does not feature a school child and $50 for teams that are not from Bulawayo. – @innocentskizoe.
