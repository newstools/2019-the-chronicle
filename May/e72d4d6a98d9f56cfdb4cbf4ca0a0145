The Chronicle THE Bangladesh Cricket Board has changed the colour scheme of the team’s main World Cup jersey, adding the colour red to the all-green kit the players had posed in on Monday, after first approaching the ICC and then getting an approval to make the tweak. The development came after social media erupted because the initial design didn’t have any red in it; the Bangladesh national flag has a red circle on a green background. ESPNcricinfo has learnt that the ICC didn’t actually ask the BCB to drop red from their jersey, but to avoid using the colour to write the team name and numbers on the green background, as that would make it difficult to read. It has emerged that the ICC had initially approved a BCB design of a green jersey with a red stripe and white lettering. But the BCB subsequently submitted three more designs for the green kit that had no stripes, red writing, and white writing. When the ICC got back to the BCB about the red letters and numbers not being legible, the BCB sent another design that had the writing in white on both the home and away kits, but no red anywhere. The ICC had approved that design too. After the final approval, the BCB unveiled the jersey on Monday, with BCB president Nazmul Hassan handing it over to Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza prior to an official photo-op in Dhaka. “After the jersey unveiling yesterday, I sat with the board directors to look at the jersey again,” Hassan said yesterday. “Someone spotted the lack of red in the jersey. We have now decided to add the red to our jersey.” The jersey in question is one of two for the World Cup, in accordance to the ICC’s regulation to have home and away strips for the marquee event. “Initially, it was the ICC who told us to not have the red in our jersey,” Hassan said. “We have a separate jersey, completely red [with white lettering], for some of the other games.” — ESPNcricinfo
