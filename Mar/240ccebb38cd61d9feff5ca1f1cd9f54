The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS B continued with their giant killing act by felling Mavericks 60-52 in the Bulawayo Basketball League at Khanyisile Sports Centre on Saturday. Mavericks missed the services of utility player Nhlanhla Chirinda, who is facing a two-match ban after receiving an ejection in the game against Oilers. Highlanders B player Jordan Davies said his team’s performance comes from the love of the game. “We haven’t lost a game in the second half of the season and our momentum has been high in every game we’ve played. Mavericks played a good game, but we managed to contain them to ensure we emerged winners,” said Davies. “We’re leaving no stone unturned all the way to the play-offs and we hope the guys keep playing well. The fitter the team is getting, the more we’re going to cause a lot of problems for whoever we’re going to play against as we’ve shown that our team is not an easy go.” He said their intent was clear from the onset because they came for the kill and wanted to bury the game as soon as they could. “Later in the game, they played with more aggression as it was clear that we’re marching on. We made it pretty difficult for them and I still believe that they were caught by surprise, but in the end we got maximum points and that’s what matters.” In the ladies category, Mavericks consolidated their position at the top of the table by thrashing Nust 91-26. Second-placed Lakers maintained the pressure on the leaders after overcoming Highlanders Ladies team 57-37.
