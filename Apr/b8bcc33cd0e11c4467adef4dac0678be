The Chronicle Response to “Zinara pays US$589k to non-existent firm”. Corruption is killing this country. How on earth can someone get $5 million for an incomplete project or get it for doing nothing? This is too much. – King. Response to “UPDATED: Parliament defends Matanda-Moyo”.

Response to “Tobacco: Mthuli’s go-between pays off”. That’s a good motivation for our farmers.
