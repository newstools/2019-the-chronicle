MEMBERS of PPC Colleen Bawn Private Club have roped in Gwanda Tennis Club coach Mtshutshisi Mathema to train their children as part of efforts to develop talent in their community. The members decided to hire Mathema after Emakhandeni Tennis Club chairman Witness Jiyane and him conducted a coaching session in Colleen Bawn. Forty children from St Christopher’s Primary, Senodo Primary, Portland Primary, Gwanda Adventist and Gwanda High School participated in the event. Mathema said:
“I’m honoured to be given an opportunity to train the kids and the fact that their parents have promised to cater for my travelling expenses from Gwanda town to Colleen Bawn shows their dedication in ensuring their kids develop into professional tennis players. “My objective is to produce disciplined youngsters that will go on to represent this part of the country at national level. “The good thing is that most of these aspiring kids are young and that makes it easier to groom and prepare them for the future.” Jiyane donated tennis balls to Gwanda Tennis Academy on behalf of Emakhandeni Tennis Club and Mathema said the donation will go a long way in helping budding tennis players in Gwanda. “The gesture showed by Emakhandeni (Tennis Club) is humbling since a lot of children will benefit from the donations. “The kids were so excited when they saw some of the things brought by Witness (Jiyane) and it shows how inspired and overwhelmed they are,” said Mathema. Jiyane’s visit to the Matabeleland South capital was part of the process of reviving Gwanda Tennis Club, which hasn’t been active for some years. — @DecoDecent2
