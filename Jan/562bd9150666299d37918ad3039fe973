POLICE in Matabeleland South have launched a manhunt for a farmworker who allegedly stole a motor vehicle at his workplace in Matopo, only to dump it after he was involved in an accident in Bulawayo. Brian Mpala, who is employed at Famona Farm along Bulawayo-Matopo Road, broke into a room at the farm and stole car keys for an Isuzu Twin Cab before driving off unnoticed. The car theft occurred in the early hours of Thursday. Mpala was involved in an accident in Bulawayo’s CBD hours later and the car was recovered by police dumped at the accident scene after he had fled. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident saying the suspect was at large.
