Minister of Finance and Economic Development Professor Mthuli Ncube is expected to officially open the three-day occasion.

Some of the presenters are from outside the country. Other topics include “Unmasking the effect of currency change on pension savings” as well as an update on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. The state of the country’s pension industry, especially the turmoil that faced the sector after the introduction of multi-currency in 2009 when thousands of people lost their savings, is likely to steal the show.
