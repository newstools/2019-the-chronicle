The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma RHUMBA musician Madlela Skhobokhobo is billed to perform in South Africa this week. Madlela of the Ngamnanka fame is scheduled to grace the official opening of Kingdom Blue Funeral Services in Diepsloot on Saturday afternoon where he will perform alongside Shwi Nomtekhala, Freddy Gwala, Bekezela, Zinjaziyamluma, Platform 1, Dubia Masters and Amakhosi Amahle. From there, he will perform at the Hillbrow Theatre in the evening. He will be joined on stage by Dubia Masters and Mehlokazulu. The musician-cum-actor recently dropped two singles Celebrate with former Mokis frontman Themba “Bayoyo” Mathe and Bhajila as well as As I Pray with Thandy Dlana. He said Johannesburg fans will be lucky as he will officially launch the singles at the Hillbrow concert. His celebration song seems to be doing well as it went up the ladder last week from number 6 to number 1 on Khulumani FM’s Tshibilika top 10. However, Madlela, who seems to be failing to surpass Ngamnanka’s feat, said he is now back in the game with these singles as well as bookings which he is getting. “Since dropping my two singles, things are falling into place. The coming two weeks are set to be the busiest in my career with performances in Zimbabwe and South Africa lined up,” Madlela said. “I’ll be taking my full band to South Africa and people will definitely see the other side of Madlela in action. “People in the neighbouring country have never seen me performing live and I want to promise them a good show which will be laced with my comedy skits.” — @mthabisi_mthire
