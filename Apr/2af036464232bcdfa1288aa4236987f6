THE curtain comes down on the 2019 Edition of Commissioner General of Police Sports Gala where the national team to represent Zimbabwe in the regional games will be selected at Morris Depot today. Athletes from various provinces have been battling it out in eight sporting disciplines. The best performers will be included in the Team Zimbabwe for the 10th edition of the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation Organisation bi-annual games slated for Luanda, Angola, from August 1-15 this year. The teams battled in athletics, darts, chess, football (men and women), netball, shooting and volleyball (men and women). Shooting was added to the disciplines in preparation of the President’s Medal Shoot competition later this year. Other disciplines such as swimming, golf and bodybuilding have been excluded as they will not feature in the SARPCCO sporting codes. ZRP Acting Staff Officer Sports, Joshua Tigere, said it was all systems go. “This year we have fewer teams, especially in ball games, as others were eliminated at provincial level.’’ The Zimbabwe Republic Police are the defending champions of SARPCCO trophy which they last won in Swaziland in 2015.
