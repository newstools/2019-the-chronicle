I am really grateful for all the support I got here. We are really grateful to the sponsors; we hope that other sponsors will follow in the footsteps of Gweru guys, we are really happy that we got some prize money and trophies,” Dlodlo said. On why he thought he was better than his challengers, Dlodlo indicated hard work that he puts in at the gym. “What made me win was my spirit. I love gym with all my heart. I spend 95 percent (of my time) in the gym. I can’t stay without training; I always have something that is pushing me whether I am not in good condition, but my spirit is always willing.” Dlodlo is now eyeing a third consecutive Mr Zimbabwe title when the national championships are held in Harare at the end of September. The middleweight division went to Munyamana who also walked away with US$300. Mario Garacha of Harare was second and pocketed US$200, while and third spot went to Prechard “Carter” Hoko of Body Works Gym, who got US$120. <img class=" wp-image-451163" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Kylie-MacDonald-with-all-the-trophies-won-by-Body-Works-Gym-athletes-at-the-Muscle-and-Fitness-Open-Classic-in-Gweru-360x212.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="401" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Kylie-MacDonald-with-all-the-trophies-won-by-Body-Works-Gym-athletes-at-the-Muscle-and-Fitness-Open-Classic-in-Gweru-360x212.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Kylie-MacDonald-with-all-the-trophies-won-by-Body-Works-Gym-athletes-at-the-Muscle-and-Fitness-Open-Classic-in-Gweru.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px" /> Kylie MacDonald with all the trophies won by Body Works Gym athletes at the Muscle and Fitness Open Classic in Gweru MacDonald continued to shine in bodybuilding with a third title in just a month when she took home the Female fitness.
