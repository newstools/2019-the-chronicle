The Chronicle  THERESA May is planning fresh indicative votes as the humiliated Prime Minister plots to reawaken her botched Brexit withdrawal agreement. Mrs May is under severe pressure from her party and Parliament to finally find a way through the EU negotiations. According to the Daily Telegraph, she is preparing to hold votes within two weeks if her controversial discussions with Labour breakdown. Under consideration are a number of methods to get the UK’s exit over the line, including getting MPs to rank the alternative Brexit outcomes in order of preference. The method could see second and third choices being counted if no majority of preferred options claims a majority. A senior Government source told the newspaper said: “There are several ways of doing it. “If we can’t agree a Brexit deal with Labour we will move on to discussing a new round of indicative votes and how they could be done.” However, the plan was condemned by a Cabinet minister who likened it to a scene from comedy “Auf Wiedersehen Pet”. The source said: “There is a scene in Auf Wiedersehen Pet, where the builders pick a colour to paint their shed and end up with yellow. “They are all baffled because no-one voted for yellow, but it turns out that two people put it down as their second choice. “So there is an issue with a ranking system, as it comes with the inherent danger that you end up with a result that no-one wanted.” Different alternatives have been also been touted, such as a knockout system where the least popular options are removed after each round of voting. The Conservative leader still believes she can get her deal over the line with the support of Labour. Her withdrawal agreement has been roundly trounced three times by Parliament. In April, MPs consider eight different option but were unable to get a majority on any of them. Mrs May hopes that she can push through her withdrawal agreement by May 22, the day before the EU elections. – The Mirror
