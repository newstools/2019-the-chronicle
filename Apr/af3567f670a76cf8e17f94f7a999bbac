The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Business Correspondent A BULAWAYO leather company, First Page Leather Products, has heaped praises on the organisers of this year’s Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) saying it benefited from participating. The 60th edition of the ZITF which ended on Saturday, attracted 532 direct local exhibitors and 14 foreign countries. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni officially opened the event on Friday. Sales manager Mr Tendai Zvinoira said his organisation had in the past overlooked the benefits of exhibiting at the ZITF preferring regional exhibitions. He said participating at this year’s international trade showcase opened his eyes as he met new local clients. “We are in the Central Business District but the clients from the city we met here at ZITF thought that this company is from outside the city. They seemed shocked that we are a local company,” said Mr Zvinoira. He said after the fair, he expected an increase in new direct local customers now that most residents are aware the company is based in the city. Mr Zvinoira said despite the harsh economic environment, the leather products sector was thriving because it was exporting. He said forexample his company was exporting belts, shoes and wallets to countries such as Malawai, Zambia, Namibia, China and some European countries. He said the local demand for their products was also growing as people now wanted quality products as opposed to cheap imports. “In the past people used to rush for these cheap imports because of their low prices but many people now know that these products are not durable,” said Mr Zvinoira. -@nqotshili
