The Chronicle Mpumelelo Nyoni, Chronicle Reporter TELECOMMUNICATIONS firm Econet Wireless has raised RTGS$ 479 287 through its EcoCash platform towards Cyclone Idai relief efforts. In a notice yesterday, Econet Wireless said: “We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all the people who rose to the call and contributed towards the Cyclone Idai relief fund through the EcoCash biller code 320041. “You raised RTGS$ 239 643.58 and Econet has matched dollar for dollar to make the total RTGS$ 479 287.16. The money has been channeled towards the purchase of food supplies for affected families and search and rescue efforts.” Cyclone Idai, which ravaged Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, was recently declared a regional disaster by the Southern African Development Community (Sadc). Econet Wireless responded to Cyclone Idai, set up “Camp Econet” a help and relief centre, right at the epicentre of the disaster in Chimanimani. Commenting on his Facebook page recently, Econet Wireless founder, Mr Strive Masiyiwa said after the disaster, the company’s objective for the first three weeks was to find and rescue hundreds of people left stranded. “Some were on rooftops, trees, mountain tops; others were in their flooded homes,” said Mr Masiyiwa. He commended rescuers, both from government and volunteers in all three countries affected by the cyclone saying they did their best, often with minimal resources and equipment. “Then came the relief effort: trying to get as much food, clothing and blankets to thousands of people left homeless and destitute. This is where so many of you have played an amazing role; you have mobilised in your homes, churches, mosques, schools, colleges, universities, and online and work places to help out. Working together, also with local and international relief agencies, we have all averted starvation amongst the survivors so far,” said Mr Masiyiwa.
