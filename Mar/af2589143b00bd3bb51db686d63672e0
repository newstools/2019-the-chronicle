CONCERNED Highlanders Football Club supporters have taken matters into their own hands by launching a social media crowd funding initiative to help raise funds that will be channelled towards meeting their striking players’ salary bill. Bosso players have been on strike since the beginning of the week demanding to be paid their outstanding two months’ salaries, a revolt that has seen it’s technical team working mainly with the Bosso 90 developmental side. “Our team needs us. Let’s help it with the little that we have. 99274 is the biller code. We need to act good people,” posted Sja Sitsha Wuyane in one of the Bosso supporters’ Facebook page Bosso updates. The page has 55 197 active members and Wuyane believes if each member contributes at least RTGS$1 towards the fundraising drive, they will be able to raise the required amount. “Thank you . We will rescue our Bosso. # Bosso for Life# Please inform the executive to always update us the legion of fans all over the globe. Bosso is a brand, it can only move forward without hassles if the fans are kept up to date on all happenings . We love our team but there is a gap with the supporters. #Operation Rescue Bosso am in,” responded a concerned Highlanders fan, Lengton Zivanai. Another supporter, Andifasi Banda, suggested that each contribution must be at least RTGS$2 so as to double the amount. “I think that’s a good idea and it is part of fundraising for the club since it’s a community club. A $2 per person will double that amount,” posted Banda. Highlanders are engaged in sponsorship talks with mobile telecommunications giant NetOne and its believed the engagements are at an advanced stage. The labour unrest at the Bulawayo giants comes with just under a month before the 2019 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season gets underway and a few days before they take on Chicken Inn in the ZNA Charities match.
