BULAWAYO-based tennis player who trains with GC Tennis Centre at the Bulawayo Athletic Club (BAC) Kudzai Chapepa yesterday lost the finals of the Under-12 Belgrave Junior Tournament held in Groenkloof, Pretoria in South Africa after losing to the host nation’s Marize Van 3-6; 6-4; 2-6. The 10-year-old who is a pupil at Carmel Primary School surprised her coach, Thesly Mufunda, who wasn’t expecting her to reach the final playing away from home. Mufunda said he believes Chapepa learnt a lot from the tournament as she defied all odds and beat players who’re in South Africa’s Under-12 top 10 ranking en route to the final. “It is unfortunate that she lost the final but there’s a lot to learn from this experience. Nonetheless, I’m proud of Kudzai (Chapepa) and I was surprised by her dedication during the course of the tournament,” said Mufunda. He said there are things they need to work on which they picked during the final match and chief among them being to ensure that she gets as much exposure as she can. “She won the first set and led in the second one but failed to maintain the lead and I think she got excited before sealing the competition. We tried to ensure that she avoids complacency but such experiences are a blessing in disguise as it will help her mature in preparations for the upcoming games,” said Mufunda. He said they were invited to take part in another tournament to be held in Bloemfontein, Free State Province in two months’ time. “We’re going back home with our heads high, having learnt a lot from this tournament and gained vast experience. I’m glad she is eager to come back to South Africa and ensure that she doesn’t repeat the same mistakes,” he said. – @DecoDecent2
