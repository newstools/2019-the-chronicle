A 38-YEAR-OLD man from Umguza has appeared in court for insulting his neighbour who was restraining him from assaulting his wife. Nonhlanhla Ndlovu pleaded guilty to criminal insult when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya who warned, cautioned and discharged him. The court heard that Ms Pretty Chunda (42), who is Ndlovu’s neighbour, was insulted by the accused person for trying to restrain him from assaulting his wife when he came home drunk early this month. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said on February 2, Ndlovu arrived home drunk. “On February 2 this year at around 1AM, Ndlovu went to his home from a nearby bar drunk and started to assault his wife inside the house. The wife started screaming and that drew the attention of Ms Chunda who woke up and went to restrain Ndlovu from hurting his wife,” said Mr Mageza. “Ndlovu insulted Ms Chunda mentioning her mother and cursed her saying she would be struck by lightning for not minding her own business.” The court heard that Ms Chunda left the house and went to report the matter to the police on the same day leading to Ndlovu’s arrest. — @gwizi_n.
