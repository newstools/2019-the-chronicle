AIM is a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange, launched on June 19, 1995. It allows smaller, less-viable companies to float shares with a more flexible regulatory system than is applicable to the main market. The company said it has a total common number of shares in issue of 10 763 041. The company is currently seeking ways to deepen its investment in Zimbabwe despite the challenging economic conditions the country is facing. The mine has been producing for a century despite a temporary shut-down from October 2008 to April 2009 at the height of Zimbabwe’s economic woes. Caledonia is expanding production at the mine in Gwanda and says it is confident the country’s economy will recover from its problems to re-invest on a modest scale. — @queentauruszw.
