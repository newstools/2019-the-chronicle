The Chronicle The Amsterdam City council has announced that it will prohibit the sale of alcohol in the Red Light District before Ajax host Chelsea in the Champions League today. This decision was made in an effort to reduce the risk of any unwanted fan trouble in the city centre ahead of the European tie. The temporary ‘dry law’ will be applied between 12:00 and 18:00 local time, with the match kicking off at 18:55. If any establishment is caught still selling alcohol between those hours, they risk a fine of 1 200 euros, AS reported. “Traditionally, foreign football fans go to the Red Light District before a game. This is accompanied by a lot of drinking. Previously, residents and businesses in the area have suffered huge inconvenience and the police have had to intervene,” said the statement. The Dutch authorities have classified Champions League Group H match as high-risk, with around 3 000 Chelsea supporters expected to make the trip to the Dutch capital. In March 2018, hundreds of English fans were involved in fights across the Red Light District when Holland hosted England in an international friendly. The trouble led to over 100 arrests and 25 travelling fans being detained — a problem the council want to try and prevent from happening again. Chelsea supporters have also been part of some unsavoury scenes in recent years when their side travelled to Paris. Fans took the streets and metro lines in the French capital where fights broke out and damage was caused. The match could prove pivotal in Frank Lampard’s bid to get Chelsea to the knockout stages of the Champions League in his first season as manager. Chelsea made up for the 1-0 loss in their curtain raiser against Valencia with a 2-1 victory against Lille in the last round of matches. The hosts have had a perfect start to their campaign with wins in both their opening matches. — Dailyonline.
