As part of the celebrations, the group showcased their ‘Dlala’ production. They kicked off the show with a highly energetic traditional Zulu dance performance which impressed the audience. From there they performed various dances including the Setapa dance from Botswana, gumboot dance as well as modern dance pieces – showing off their talent and diversity. The group’s director, Future Dube, said: “It was amazing to see many people turning out to support us. It’s quite motivating to see that people actually appreciate our work.” Dube said their focus was now on their upcoming tour of Matabeleland. “This event was also meant to prepare us for the upcoming Matabeleland tour that we’re still planning and raising funds for,” he said. Next month, the group will exhibit at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair.
