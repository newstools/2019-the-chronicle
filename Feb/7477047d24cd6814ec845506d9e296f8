THE Competition and Tariff Commission has warned businesses and schools engaging in anti-competitive practices in the supply and distribution of uniforms that the body will not hesitate to invoke the law to deal with errant entities. The warning comes following reports that some shops were selling uniforms at exorbitant prices while some schools were compelling parents to buy from specific suppliers. In a statement yesterday, the CTC said that it will set up a market inquiry to the school uniforms sector to investigate allegations of restrictive practices. “Allegations of anti-competitive practices in the supply and distribution of school uniforms, including compelling parents to buy from a specific supplier and tying and bundling when selling uniforms, among others have come to the attention of the Commission,” read the statement. “Against this background therefore, the Commission would like to warn any businesses or schools engaging in any of the above mentioned practices to desist from engaging in such practices with immediate effect.” The Commission said anyone who fails to comply with any provision of the Competition Act shall be found guilty and attract a fine or jail term. Last month Primary and Secondary Education Minister Professor Paul Mavima said parents must procure uniforms from the best quotation they can get and must not be forced to buy from schools. This followed concerns by some parents who said schools were working with retailers to inflate prices for their benefit. Prof Mavima said all schools are expected to ensure good governance, transparency and a corrupt-free process in the management of schools. Some schools have preferred retailers and refuse to admit pupils who buy uniforms elsewhere. There was an outcry after retailers allegedly colluded to increase the prices of school uniforms by more than 200 percent ahead of the opening of schools last month. — @esinathy_essira
