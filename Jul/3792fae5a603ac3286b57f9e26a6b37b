The Chronicle Editor: Please kindly assist. I speak on behalf of the late Josphat Ngwenya who passed away on December 21, 2008. He was a designer at Kara Sons. There is a workmate who took a Phillips mountain bike for repairs. The repairman stayed at Hillside by then. May all those who know the repairman or him in person please contact P Mandati on 0775583066 on the issue of the unreturned bicycle. Sorry if the delay irks you but l hope for assistance from well-wishers. Thank you so much.
