Pardon Ndlovu and Brighton Zimuto were drinking at Marinoha Business Centre when they had a misunderstanding over an undisclosed issue. They exchanged blows but a villager, Mr Knowledge Ngwenya managed to restrain them. “Two days later Ndlovu and Zimuto met at the business centre and they had an altercation which emanated from the previous grudge. Ndlovu stabbed Zimuto in the chest before fleeing from the scene. Zimuto bled profusely and he staggered for a distance of about 10 metres before he collapsed and died. The matter was reported to the police who attended the scene and Zimuto’s body was taken to Maphisa District Hospital Mortuary,” he said. Sgt Mguni said police had launched a manhunt for Ndlovu and he appealed to members of the public with information on his whereabouts to contact any nearest police station. – @DubeMatutu
