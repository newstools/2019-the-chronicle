The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
THE Victoria Falls Border Post will be closed for two hours this morning between 6AM and 8AM to cater for the launch of a majestic jet boat on the Zambezi River. Shearwater Adventures is re-introducing the Jet Boat years after its first boat was swept away by the river while docking at night. In a statement, the Emerged Railways Property Limited, which manages the Victoria Falls Bridge, said the bridge and border would be closed for public use this morning. “The public is hereby notified that that the Victoria Falls Bridge will not be available for public use for about two hours on Saturday, March 2, 2019 from 6AM to 8AM. “This is to facilitate the off-loading and launch of a jet boat from the bridge into the gorge by a tour operator in Victoria Falls Zimbabwe and Livingstone Zambia,” read the statement. The Victoria Falls Bridge is on the No Man’s land between Zimbabwe and Zambia border posts. A fortnight ago, the launch of the jet boat was aborted after officials from the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority stopped proceedings arguing that the tour operator had not cleared with the authority. Shearwater spokesperson Mr Clement Mukwasi yesterday said all paperwork had been done and the boat was ready to be launched. A jet boat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craft. It is a type of cruise boat that sails downstream on the rapids and fast flowing water starting from underneath the Victoria Falls Bridge up to around rapid number four. It’s availability will help both police and rescuers in the event there are bodies of people drowned in the river as it sails mainly to where such bodies are deposited by water. — @ncubeleon
