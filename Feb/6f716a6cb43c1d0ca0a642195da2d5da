After being disbanded for 12 years, the Amakhosi Cultural Centre – the country’s biggest home of visual and performing arts – is set to re-launch its theatre arts production and performance unit on March 27. The re-launch at the Amakhosi Cultural Centre will coincide with the World Theatre Day celebrations.
Amakhosi Theatre which was founded by renowned playwright, producer and director Cont Mhlanga in 1980 stopped functioning in 2007 after the banning of their play The Good President. The prevailing political situation then also made it increasingly difficult for them to produce and tour their plays. Other productions from the Amakhosi Theatre were Nansi le Ndoda and Workshop Negative. Amakhosi Theatre Rep, as the newly re-launched institution will be known, is part of efforts by the new Amakhosi management to revive the performing arts institution. “We’re excited that Amakhosi Theatre will bring back professional theatre seasons and theatre tours deep into communities that had died when Amakhosi Theatre was disbanded some 12 years ago. This impacted negatively on the growth of the theatre industry in the western region and in Zimbabwe as a whole,” Thulani Mbambo, head of production at the newly revived theatre outfit said. Amakhosi Theatre Rep’s artistic director, Charles Musungah invited aspiring actors to attend auditions for their productions which will be held on Saturday. “Amakhosi Theatre will re-launch with a cast of six and a crew of two and it will expand from there. We’re calling on those who’re aspiring to be actors and think they have some acting talent from around the city to come through for auditions at the centre. “The auditions will start at 11AM and end at 5PM.” Musungah said the new Amakhosi Theatre Rep talent would stage their debut performance during the World Theatre Day celebrations.
