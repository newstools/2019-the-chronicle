The Chronicle  Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS’s new 2019 kit is in the process of being properly branded and the Bulawayo giants will for now be using their 2018 One fusion kit which they received towards the end of last season. Reacting to concerns from fans and supporters over the ‘new’ kit that was used at the sponsorship unveiling ceremony last Friday which was described as ugly, Bosso’s chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube said that was not the kit they will be using this year. “Our new kit is coming,” said Dube while addressing the media at the club offices Thursday afternoon.
