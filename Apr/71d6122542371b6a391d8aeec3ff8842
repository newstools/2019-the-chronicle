The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter IF you love mature music, food, fashion and the finer things in life, then the Jazz and Soul Sundae is an event you might want to find yourself at. This lifestyle event is held monthly on the last Sunday at Green Gardens in Matsheumhlophe, Bulawayo. Event organiser, Morris Touch, said the event is aimed at giving revellers a unique experience in a relaxed environment. “Jazz and Soul Sundae is a lifestyle event that is tailor -made for people who appreciate the finer things in life. It’s also for those who want to have a unique experience of going out and having a great time, far away from the madding crowd.” Entertainment at the event which begins at midday is provided by various artistes with Josh Meck, Jeys Marabini and The Cool Crooners set to lead the pack this Sunday. Tickets to the event have been pegged at RTGS$10. Morris said this event was born out of his love for Jazz music whose genre is slowly fading away in the city. With this event, he hopes to keep the genre alive and give artistes a platform to perform. “I’ve always been a huge fan of jazz music and after realising that the Jazz segment was not being catered for in terms of shows, I decided to introduce the Jazz and Soul Sundae. “However, we don’t only play Jazz music but also other mature genres like Soul, RnB, Afro Contemporary and Old Skool Music.” He said he is very particular when it comes to artistes who perform as he wants the event to grow. “The vision I have for this event is to see it becoming big such that it attracts people from other parts of the country. In the long run, we’ll invite Jazz and Soul artistes from outside the country to perform,” Morris said. To make the event more appealing, Morris decided to include a fashion showcase meant for fashion enthusiasts.
