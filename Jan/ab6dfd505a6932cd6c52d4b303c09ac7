The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls
VICTORIA Falls’ representatives in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League, Mosi Rovers are set to kick-start their preparations for the 2019 season on Monday. Having survived relegation in the past two seasons when the club finished in identical 12th position, Mosi Rovers know they have to do better in their third season this year. Club secretary Mduduzi Dlodlo said they will be retaining the bulk of players and coaching department led by Zibonele Ncube. “We’re starting training on Monday where we’re going to analyse recommendations from the coaching department and see where they want to beef up. We’re not changing the coaching department at least for now but we might bolster it on the technical side. We’ll also be retaining the bulk of the players we had last season,” said Dlodlo. He said the club may add one or two seasoned players while captain Ndabenkulu Ndlovu might retire because of advanced age. He said they were planning a pre-season friendly match with an unnamed Zambian club from Livingstone. “We finished in position 12 for two years and we want to improve and contest for top four next season,” added Dlodlo. He appealed to the Victoria Falls community to continue supporting the team which carries the sole role of bringing football glory to the resort town. Two seasons ago Victoria Falls had Amagagasi and Victoria Falls Tigers and both were relegated. “We’re humbled by being the only team in Victoria Falls but we are not individualistic. We appeal to all soccer enthusiasts to come forward so we work together for betterment of sport in our town,” he added. Hwange FC finished top of the Southern Region log table to make a quick return to top flight football, after one year in the wilderness. Victoria Falls have never had a team in the PSL. — @ncubeleon
