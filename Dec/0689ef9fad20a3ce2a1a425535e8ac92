The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Bulawayo’s fast-rising rapper, Msiz’Kay who missed out on the Bulawayo Arts Awards this year after Asaph beat him to it for the Outstanding Hip Hop Artiste Award, finally got his recognition this past weekend when he was announced as the Best Alternative Sound at the Zimbabwe Hip Hop Awards held in Harare. The Inkomo Zamalobolo hit-maker was on a quest to penetrate the local music scene and spent the better part of the year pushing his brand and music. Clearly, it all paid off as he got recognised at national level. Through his Rap Lab, Khulumani’s Thorn Laroq was also awarded for being the best hip hop DJ in the country shrugging stiff competition from ZiFM Stereo’s Lady K and Pd the Ghost, Heart and Soul’s Mic Sprinter, Star FM’s Mox amd Power FMs Promethious. It was a bad day for Asaph who was nominated in six categories as he did not win anything. The ninth edition of Zim Hip-hop awards held at  a local restaurant and bar on Saturday evening, saw rappers T-Mula, King 98, Ti Gonzi, Phreshy, Jamal, Stunner and Mudiwa walk away with gongs. Flamboyant rapper Mudiwa won the People’s choice award while his rival Stunner scooped the Best Personality of the Year. Speaking at the sidelines of the show, Aldrian “Beefy” Harrison – founder of the Zim Hip-hop awards said he was happy with the turnout and support from the corporate world.
