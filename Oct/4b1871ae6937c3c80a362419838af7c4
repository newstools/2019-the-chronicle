The Chronicle Editor — The Government must make it mandatory or compulsory for all MPs to participate in the debate of all Bills or issues concerning our country. That is what those MPs were elected for and are being paid for. So, if they walk out, they must not receive pay from the tax payers as that amounts to negligence of duty. That they do not agree with an issue or that they do not like Zanu-PF or the incumbent President is not a valid excuse for them to just walk out during a Parliament session. They must work for the money which they earn. Any MPs who conduct themselves in that manner must be removed from those posts as they do not render the public services which they are/were elected to render.That is why so many issues remain unresolved due to these lazy MPs. If they do not want to attend Parliament sessions, then they must be removed from serving their constituencies. It is in Parliament that issues that concern the public are debated and resolved. So, if they don’t attend Parliament sessions they serve no purpose except to earn the public tax payers money for nothing. That has to stop. Every MP must be obligated to attend all Parliament sessions, unless if they are incapacitated by illness.We understand that there is a rift between Zanu-PF and MDC, but must Parliament stop functioning just because of those differences? How are those differences going to be resolved if no debate takes place? It is better to vent out your grievances and the grievances of the people that you represent than to just keep quiet. Be outspoken. Be heard. Njabulo, Bulawayo
