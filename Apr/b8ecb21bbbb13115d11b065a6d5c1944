The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma INTELLECTUALS get out of your comfort zone and embrace the challenge as Dreamstar Zimbabwe is searching for talent at universities nationwide. The talent search show which is now in its sixth season, began the search at MSU this past Saturday. This week the team will be at the Great Zimbabwe University on Saturday followed by UZ next Saturday. Dancer, Martin Chabuka who was a finalist on the show, is growing in the arts industry. He is nominated in three categories for this years’ National Arts Merit Awards. Dreamstar Zimbabwe communication officer Tinashe Kitchen said they are still in talks with other tertiary institutions as they aim to tap and nurture student’s talents. “We’re still negotiating with other universities for dates. After the university tour, we’ll have the city auditions on dates to be announced,” Kitchen said. Last year, 5 000 people showed up for the auditions with a bigger number expected this year. “We’re very proud of the young talent we’ve discovered through the programme. It’s gratifying that the young talent is now being recognised and promoted on national and international platforms. “We’ll continue to provide opportunities for more young people to reach their full potential through the arts,” he said. Those who wish to register to participate in the competition are urged to visit the Dreamstar Facebook page for more information. The winner of the show will bag $3 000 while second and third placed will get $1 500 and $750 respectively. Last year’s competition was won by singer, Desire Makoni. – @mthabisi_mthire
