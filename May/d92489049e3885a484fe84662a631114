Event organiser, Bruce Ncube, said the event was also his way of giving the city’s artistes a platform to perform adding that a lot has been planned for the free event that starts at midday. “We’re definitely taking this event a level up. I think people/sponsors are starting to believe in our dream judging from the support that we’re receiving. We have a great line up which is going to keep people entertained,” said Ncube. As has been the case with the previous editions, there will be traditional food stalls at the venue for people to sample African cuisine. Dishes on the menu will include amacimbi, amazambane and inkobe.
