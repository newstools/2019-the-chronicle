The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter PREPARATIONS for the third edition of the Binga Kasambabezi Marathon are gathering momentum, with the organisers setting May 15 as the deadline for registration. The event will be held at Binga Centre on May 18 and more than 40 runners are expected to take to the road in the 5km, 10km, 21km and 42 km races. There will also be a 10km wheelchair race. “So far we have held about three preparatory meetings that have all been very fruitful. We have distributed registration forms and fliers around the district and the enthusiasm shown by locals is very encouraging indeed,” said Samuel Mugande, the district development officer in the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation. He said besides promoting health and fitness, the marathon will help expose Binga to the outside world and also promote tourism since the area is known for its diverse cultural beliefs. “We also hope to use the meet to select Binga representatives for the internationally acclaimed Econet Victoria Falls Marathon, which is just around the corner in the resort town of Victoria Falls. We are confident as organisers of this competition that it’s going to be an exciting family day,” said Mugande.
