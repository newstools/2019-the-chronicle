The Chronicle Natasha Chamba, Business Reporter THE Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, Raj Modi, has said his recent visits to India have so far attracted over 120 potential Indian investors into the country. In an interview on the sidelines of the public finance management reform indaba hosted by the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (ZIMCODD) at a Bulawayo hotel last Friday, Deputy Minister Modi said his business visits to India were promising positive outcomes. “Since my visit to India last year in November up to now, we have got more than 120 people who have come into Zimbabwe to explore ways to invest in the country and they are still coming,” he said. “A lot of things are in the pipeline. It is not an easy route because the thing with investors is that they first come to explore and make sure everything is ok. They will be checking, asking questions before they make claims to invest.” The Deputy Minister said so far the country has been getting positive feedback from potential investors who have been coming to Zimbabwe. When Deputy Minister Modi went to India last year in November, the Indian Institute of Gems and Jewellery (IIGJ) in Jaipur made a commitment to help Zimbabwe acquire skills in jewellery designing and proposed to offer scholarships to Zimbabwean students with an interest in jewellery manufacturing. Meanwhile, during the public finance management (PFM) session, the Deputy Minister, in his keynote address, said the full implementation of prudent management systems will enhance efficient and effective utilisation of public resources. “Full implementation of the PFMS will enhance efficient and effective utilisation of public resources. It also enhances transparency, accountability and eliminates distortions in financial reporting,” he said. The Deputy Minister echoed the sentiments of the attendants at the indaba who stressed the need for public financial systems to be transparent for accountability purposes. — @queentauruszw
