Givemore Tshuma of Nketa suburb, who was supposed to pay an unspecified amount of duty, was caught at around 7PM on Thursday after handing over 16 fake US$50 notes. ZIMRA officials apprehended him and handed him over to the police. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident. He warned members of the public, especially those in the business fraternity, to be on the outlook for fraudsters saying it was clear there was a float of fake notes out there. “We are investigating a case of fraud which occurred at Beitbridge Border Post where a suspect was arrested after he was caught with 16 x US$50 notes that he allegedly attempted to use to pay duty. “This is a clear indication that a larger float could be out there and those handling US dollars should be extra vigilant not to be robbed,” said Chief Insp Ndebele. He appealed to members of the public who may have information that may lead to the arrest of the syndicate to contact their nearest police station. — @winnie_masara.
