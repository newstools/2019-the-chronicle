The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe ladies indoor hockey team will play Spar South Africa Ladies in a five-match international Test series in Durban from May 28 to June 1. PSI Zimbabwe launched a fundraising campaign   on social media in a bid to raise funds for the team. The Zimbabwe ladies indoor hockey posted on their Facebook page appealing for financial assistance. “With the World Cup Qualifiers ahead in 2020, international Test matches are a critical component of the teams’ preparations. Since June 2017, the ladies have managed 14 international Test matches against South Africa and Namibia,” reads the post. “It is not expected that the team will receive any assistance, so the costs lie solely on the shoulders of the players and staff. The anticipated cost per person is a minimum of US$700.” Most recently, the inaugural five-match PSI international Test series against South Africa was held in Harare and PSI Zimbabwe has decided to do whatever it can to assist the team with fundraising for the trip.
