The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter THE Hockey Association of Zimbabwe (HAZ) has released an 18-member men’s squad for the forthcoming road to Tokyo Olympic Games’ qualifiers set for Stellenbosch, South Africa, next month. Captained by Tendai Maredza, Zimbabwe gets its campaign underway in Pool B against north African giants Egypt on August 12, with their second game against Namibia the following day. They wrap up their Pool B games with a contest against Ghana on August 15. Pool A has Uganda, Nigeria and hosts South Africa, and the top two sides from each pool will progress to the semi-finals where winners of Pool A will clash with Pool B runners-up, while Pool A runners-up have a date with Pool B winners. The final will be on August 18 to decide who goes to Tokyo for the Olympic finals. Coach Tongai Mukwewa also named seven non-travelling reserves for the continental qualifiers. Africa was not represented at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games after continental winners South Africa decided against participating following a resolution between the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC) and South African Hockey Association (SAHA) that the continental qualification route would not be considered.
