The Chronicle Joseph Madzimure, Harare Bureau PRESIDENT Mnangagwa is expected to address thousands of people set to gather next Thursday for an anti-sanctions solidarity march in Harare. The march is in solidarity with Sadc member states who are calling for the removal of the illegal sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. The sanctions have decimated the economy, especially the manufacturing sector which is now contending with antiquated equipment, resulting in high costs of production and consequently high prices of finished goods. The sanctions have also blocked lines of credit, which are critical in financing production and the acquisition of latest machinery. Zanu-PF Secretary of Administration Cde Obert Mpofu yesterday said the solidarity march was being organised by the ruling Zanu-PF. He said all progressive Zimbabweans should disregard their political affiliations and take part in the solidarity march. “We want to make it a national event. The solidarity march will include Government, civil society, students, the business community and members of different political parties. The event is in fact open to everyone,” said Cde Mpofu. The development comes after Sadc countries declared October 25 as a solidarity day against illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe and resolved to conduct various activities in their respective countries on the day to resoundingly call for the immediate removal of the sanctions. The Sadc secretariat has since been tasked to escalate the lobby with the current African Union chairperson, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who will be expected to raise the issue at the upcoming 74th United Nations General Assembly scheduled for this month.
