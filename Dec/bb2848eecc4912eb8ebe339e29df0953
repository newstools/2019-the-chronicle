The driver of the kombi was travelling towards Masvingo and allegedly lost control of the vehicle,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said the Toyota Hiace hit a tree, veered off the road to the right side, rolled once and landed on its right side killing three people on the spot. Asst Comm Nyathi said the driver who was only identified as Takudza Chipindu fled from the scene. “Surprisingly, the driver ran away after the accident yet we expect him to cooperate with the police. We have however launched a manhunt and the long arm of the law will catch up with him,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi advised the motoring public to be extra cautious when travelling on national roads, especially towards the festive season. “Motorists should just be responsible and drive cautiously without speeding. They should learn to be responsible so that they make sure that they do not cause unnecessary road carnage which has claimed many lives.” — @walterbmswazie2
