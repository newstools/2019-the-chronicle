The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Business Reporter REGIONAL seed producer, SeedCo Limited, has introduced a competition meant to boost small-scale farmers’ production. The competion called “Eleven Tonnes plus Judging” was launched this week at MaryEllen Farm in Bubi district, Matabeleland North. The farmers who are able to produce 11 tonnes or more per hectare join the commercial club, an elite group of farmers that are then rewarded for producing high yields per hectare. “We check how many tonnes a farmer has produced per hectare and if it’s more than 11 tonnes, he or she joins the club for commercial farmers,” SeedCo commercial agronomist, Mr Philip Matombo said. He said Mr Peter Evans who runs MaryEllen Farm produced more than 14 tonnes per hectare. Mr Matombo said farmers can only increase their yields per hectare if they use the right seed. “I also urge farmers to follow the right procedure when farming to enable them to produce more per hectare,” he said. The company’s regional sales manager, Mr Silas Mutota said the competion was meant to motivate farmers to produce more per hectare hence the decision to reward those that meet or surpass the target of 11 tonnes per hectare. Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers’ Union (ZCFU), regional representative Mr Winston Innocent Babbage said farmers were committed to increasing production per hectare but were at times constrained by lack of equipment such as tractors. He urged Government to assist in equipping the farmers so that they could realise more from their land. — @sharonbuwe.
