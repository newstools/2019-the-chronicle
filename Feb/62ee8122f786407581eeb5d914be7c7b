THE inaugural Star FM Music Awards have been described as a resounding success as everything went according to plan and the event went along without a major glitch. The awards were held last Friday at Harare’s Zimbali Leisure Centre where ExQ walked away the biggest winner on the night with five awards. Zimpapers Radio Division General Manager Comfort Mbofana said the awards were a great event that honoured local artistes. “It was a great event and we achieved our goal of honouring our musicians and help in bringing value to the music industry. Guests set the standards sartorially and the event was oversubscribed. We thank those who came to support our artistes being acknowledged,” said Mbofana. He added: “The whole award process was supervised by reputable auditors from Baker Tilly International who issued a certificate stipulating that everything was done with integrity and above board.” Star FM Awards manager Zandile “Zaza” Ndlovu said the organising team pulled off a incredible event and thanked various sponsors and partners. “As a first time event I believe our team pulled off a fantastic event. We brought glitz and glamour to the arts industry. We are extremely grateful to our awards’ partners including the likes of Impala Car Rental, Derby Cheryl, Econet Buddy Beatz, Jan Jam, Club Sankayi, Style by Minnie and Nafuna Tv,” said Zaza. She said sponsors should be commended for chipping in despite the fact that the country was facing economic challenges. “They saw it important to partner and support us during a very trying and challenging economic phase in our country,” said Zaza who also congratulated all the winners during the night.
