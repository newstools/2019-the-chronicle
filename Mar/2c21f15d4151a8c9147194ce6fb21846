The Chronicle Ellina Mhlanga, Harare Bureau THE Zimbabwe Netball Association (Zina) will this Friday host a golf day at Royal Harare as part of their fundraising activities ahead of their participation at the Netball World Cup in July. Zimbabwe are among 16 countries who will be in Liverpool, England, from July 12 to 21 for the 2019 Netball World Cup. Zina marketing partner, Francorn Mutare, said they wanted to raise $50 000 on the day. “The golf day is meant to raise funds for the Gems for their preparations, as well as the general welfare of the team, while in camp,’’ said Mutare. “This is the first of the other initiatives in place for the fund-raising campaign. “The golf day is supposed to open relationships with the corporate world, who are the main participants at such events as golf days, and help market the netball brand and give more information on the sport. “We had put a budget of $100 000, which has now been revised to $50 000, due to tight budgets with corporates.’’ Zimbabwe will face Australia, Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka in Group A at the World Cup. Zina president, Leticia Chipandu, urged the nation to rally behind the team. “This day is going to be a great day for everyone, especially the sports-loving people, and those that wish to support the Gems. “I would like to urge everyone to come and support this day because it is for a very good cause, supporting the girl child. “We are aware our Government is supporting us. It has already paid 40 percent towards our upkeep in Liverpool. “But as women, we also have to be resourceful and complement the efforts of the Government,” said Chipandu. Participation fee on the day has been pegged at $100 per person and $400 for a team of four.
