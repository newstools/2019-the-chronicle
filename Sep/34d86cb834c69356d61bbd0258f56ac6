The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS have refuted claims that goalkeepers’ coach Tembo Chuma is on his way out of the club owing to unfulfilled contractual obligations. Bosso public relations officer, Ronald Moyo, said reports of Chuma’s departure were news to them. “The club has not received anything from him that indicates he wants to leave the club. As it stands, he has a running contract up to December next year. We are only reading of his exit in the media, and remember he has not been around as he was away on national duty so we are expecting him back today (yesterday afternoon),” said Moyo. Sources had told Chronicle Sport earlier this week that Chuma, who has had enough of Bosso’s failure to fulfil their promises, has decided to pack his bags and join Gweru-based, TelOne, coached by former national team gaffer and Bosso legend, Rahman Gumbo. “He is going, make no mistake about that. The letter is drafted; he will deliver it upon his return from national duty. It’s really sad that Bosso are set to lose such a talented young coach who has produced many goalkeepers on the stars’ calendar,” said a source. Highlanders’ goalkeeper, Ariel Sibanda, has been on the soccer stars’ calendar as goalkeeper of the year twice with Chuma as the coach and when he left to join ZPC Kariba, Tendai Hove was also voted the Castle Lager Premiership goalkeeper of the year. If Chuma leaves, he will become the third member of the technical team to leave Bosso this season after former head coach Madinda Ndlovu and fitness trainer Brian Keti quit. – @innocentskizoe
