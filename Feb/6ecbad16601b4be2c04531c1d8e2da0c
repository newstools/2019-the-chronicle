THE Lakers Foundation schools tournament reached its third day of the competition when the eight teams that qualified for quarterfinals in the girls category were confirmed. Nkulumane High will entertain St James while Sizane High will have to overcome Eveline High in order to reach the semifinals. In the other last eight matches, favourites Girls High A team must beat St Francis if they are to meet team B who will have to overcome Founders High. In the boys’ category the quarter finalists weren’t yet confirmed but Plumtree-based Thekwane High was already guaranteed a place with a game to spare against Cyrene High School, who have lost all their matches. Thekwane High School coach Mbongeni Gwenzi said his team was in a good position to pose a shocker and walk away as winners. “We’re playing schools that are better than us but basketball is all about practice and exposure. In Matabeleland South we only have Nash games which is only one day tournament so with Lakers Foundation we’re being lifted up. “Basketballl is considered as an elitist sport and most people shun it because it is associated with schools that are well funded. If rural schools are exposed to these kinds of tournaments and start giving it much endurance which is needed for basketball, I’m sure something feasible will come out. If sponsors and schools invest in rural basketball, we’ll definitely match their performance,” said Gwenzi. He said his team is proud to have progressed to the next stage and the fact that the event is for junior players motivates them and gives them a lifeline to be optimistic of the future. Gwenzi challenged other rural schools to embrace basketball and start seeing it as a sport that can empower young players and earn them scholarships to play abroad. — @DecoDecent2
