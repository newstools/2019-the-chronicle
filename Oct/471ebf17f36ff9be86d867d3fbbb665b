The Chronicle Michell Zvanyanya, Features Reporter Their motto, “We strive to build a complete character”, highlights Matopo High School’s sole purpose which is to mould pupils of integrity. The Brethren In Christ Church run school is built on the belief that complete character takes a pupil to a certain level of success and keeps the pupil there. Matopo High school builds good character among pupils by providing quality academic, technical, moral and physical education. <img class="alignnone wp-image-469268 size-full" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Deputy-head-Ms-Silindile-Ncube.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Deputy-head-Ms-Silindile-Ncube.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/Deputy-head-Ms-Silindile-Ncube-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The mission of the school is to produce individuals who are equipped with skills to ensure that they fit the cultural, social and economic development of the country while endeavouring to uphold the moral vaalues of the school and society. The institution, which is surrounded by the Matobo Hills, is a beacon of success in the district, province and is competitive nationally. It needs no introduction in education circles as it represents excellence in academics. With an enrolment of 1 151 pupils comprising mainly of boarders, Matopo High School has proved beyond doubt that it is results oriented. A closer look at the school’s June results reflects that significant strides have been made by the school towards maintaining its position of being one of the best schools in the country. The results do not only reflect pupil’s intelligence but confirm that the teachers led by their headmaster Mr Gardson Sibanda, are dedicated to their duty. This year in June, the school registered its pupils for a maximum of six subjects and the results obtained were outstanding. Mr Sibanda said 49 pupils sat for five or more subjects during the June public examinations and 24 ‘O’ Level pupils now have full certificates; that is, they have acquired five O-Level passes and above. “In History we have 36 As, 12 As in Mathematics, in Combined Science we have 19 As, six in Ndebele and eight in Economics,” said Mr Sibanda. He said the results were very encouraging and motivated teachers to work harder to obtain even better results in the November examinations. The A-Level June examinations were not an exception as the school outstandingly excelled at that level as well. At A-Level, 41 pupils sat for two or more subjects in June and more than 36 pupils have at least two A-Level passes. Thelma Xamu attained a whopping 12 points and asserted her position as the top achiever in the school. The school has already recorded five A-Level pupils with ten points from two subjects. “For November examinations the school has over the years managed to produce good results and it continues to improve. The pass rate  at O-Level  is above the national average. For the past five years the pass rate keeps  getting better every year. In the past five years (2014 to 2018) the pass rates have been as follows, 71,5, 79,3, 80,2, 86,4 percent and now is at 92,2 percent,” said Mr Sibanda. The 2018 O-Level pass rate was also impressive with the best performing pupil attaining 10 As. Six pupils attained eight As and four pupils had seven As. Mr Sibanda said the aim of the school this year is to reach the epitomy of excellence and the target is to reach 100 percent pass rate at ‘A’ Level and above 92 percent at O-Level to help assert the school’s position as one of the best in the country. Not only does the school excel in academics but it also outshines other schools in the province and the country at large in extra-curricular activities. “Our debate and public speaking team represented the province at national level. “The drama club recently participated at provincial level and came second. The choir also participated at national level this year but our best performance was in 2009 when we came first at national level,” said Mr Sibanda. “In athletics, we have fielded a number of our athletes into the Matabeleland South provincial team set to participate at national level. One of our pupils has also participated outside the country by invitation. Her first assignment was in Cote d’Ivoire and she recently went to Morocco. Our basketball team also acquitted itself very well at provincial level.” Mr Sibanda said the school had long embraced Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and was procuring materials to continue supporting that department. He said the school has boosted the number of computers in both the computer lab and the library. Interactive boards have been erected in all departments with the school still hoping to secure tablets for the pupils. Mr Sibanda said the A-Level pupils bring their own tablets to promote ICT learning. The Brethren In Christ Church run school has an inclusive approach to education and has a department for physically challenged pupils. “The school highly considers the Ministry’s policy of inclusivity. The pupils living with disabilities in our school are also equipped with skills training that is in line with the new competence-based curriculum that is skills oriented. One of our physically challenged pupils participated in the national paralympic games and won,” said Mr Sibanda. As an institution, Matopo High School practices corporate social responsibility by giving back to the community, a culture that is not common in many schools. The school ensures that children from the community, particularly drop out pupils, have access to education as they are enrolled into the school with labour from their parents as form of payment. Deputy Headmaster, Ms Silindile Ncube said apart from academic excellence, the school also prioritises cleanliness and hygiene which she believes contributes to the spiritual growth of the pupils. “Some of our pupils are part of the Environmental Club that is doing exceptionally well and is in line with the Presidential command of cleanliness. The club has engaged in cleaning activities in the school, in filling up gullies and other surrounding areas,” said Ms Ncube. She said the school also provides pupils with 21st century skills for team work and collaboration for interior décor projects. Ms Ncube said the school aims at promoting creativity, collaboration, critical thinking and communication (the 4CS). A tour of the school leaves one satisfied that it is modern school that has most of the required infrastructure to meet the needs of today’s pupil. The school recently built a new boys hostel as it strives to ensure adequate accommodation for its boaders. It has also installed solar geysers at both girls and boys hostels to ensure pupils are not affected by Zesa’s load shedding. — @michellzvanyanyan2
