The Chronicle WHEN he took the podium to give his speech, the whole school screamed as pupils were excited to see renowned poet Albert Nyathi. Nyathi said it is high time learners embrace the new curriculum that is competency based and advocates for pupils to utilise their talents. “People are born with different talents. Some are soccer stars like Peter Ndlovu while people like me are poets. You should not sit on your talent but be proud of who you are and go for that. The new curriculum is giving room for talented people to excel. Never take this opportunity lightly,” he said. Nyathi said nurturing talent begins with schools appreciating who their pupils are and motivating their talents. “If Mzilikazi High School had not nurtured Peter Ndlovu and gave him an opportunity he would not have been the talk of the day as he is today. So l’m challenging schools to have eyes of eagles, see beyond the child’s academic performance and be able to support their God given gifts. It helps bring out the different person whom some of us never knew,” he said. Nyathi urged pupils not to abandon school pursuing arts. He said unlike what most people believe, Arts careers including music are not meant for school drop outs but one has to pursue their studies while nurturing their talents. “Many people believe that Arts are meant for school drop outs but that’s not the case, maybe some people unfortunately lost that opportunity of excelling in school but my children l want to tell you that never look down upon education. “Be equipped both sides, imagine the pride you take in being an educated singer. You now sing sensible things because you also have zeal to impart knowledge to other people,” he said.
