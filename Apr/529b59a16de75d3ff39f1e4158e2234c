The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls A new cricket academy has been launched in Victoria Falls to help in the development of the grassroots game. Aaron Phiri, a director of Tanajane Investments, and Alois Masamba, a director of A and J Construction, are the brains behind Titans Cricket Academy which will be based at Baobab Primary School in Victoria Falls. It will be the first ever such cricket project in Victoria Falls where sport development is limited. Titans Cricket Academy was launched yesterday at the close of the inaugural Smoke That Thunders Boys Under-14 Cricket Tournament sponsored by the two companies at Baobab Primary School. Lundi Park Primary of Gweru took part in the tournament that was won by the hosts. Both clubs fielded their A and B sides. Phiri said the tournament seeks to develop talent in schools, especially in Victoria Falls and surrounding areas. “The aim is to identify and nurture talent as we encourage schools to take part in the sport. “This will also involve rural schools through coaching clinics to promote cricket development. “We also seek to assist youths in behaviour and responsibility management on and off the field,” said Masamba. The winning team was given a shield and cricket kit. Vuyiswa Nyathi was voted best batsman, while Darreyl Masons, Collins Muleya and Sean Phiri were voted most promising player, best fielder and player of the tournament respectively. The three are all from Titans Academy. Shane Mukarati, also from Titans, emerged the top scorer with 27 runs, while Mokwetsi Chimbwire and Tawana Chikangwe from Lundi Park were voted best bowler and wicketkeeper respectively.
