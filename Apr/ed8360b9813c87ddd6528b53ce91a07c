The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Showbiz Correspondent WERE you fooled yesterday? Remember it was April Fools’ Day! The Chronicle Showbiz team pulled a prank on you, its readers on the article “Majaivana sneaks into Bulawayo”. Some of our readers fell for the prank as they made calls to the newsroom inquiring how they could get in touch with musician Lovemore Majaivana while others were seen milling around the Small City Hall, the place where the singer was purportedly holding a meeting with his relatives. However, in reality, Majaivana has not set foot in the country since self exiling nearly two decades ago. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-443167" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-3-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-3-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-3-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-3-680x529.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Untitled-3.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> The public have been yearning for his return and performance, but he has remained mum with no hope of him returning into the music scene altogether. A good number of online readers publicly confessed falling for the Fools’ Day article but others had the presence of the mind to grasp our practical joke. “sloof will attend the said Mani’s family event,” wrote one Makhehla. “Better than the usual slanting building stories this time kikikiki,” Faithfull Madau said. – @nqotshili
