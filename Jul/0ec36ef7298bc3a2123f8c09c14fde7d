The Chronicle Editor — I enjoyed reading the article about the First Lady visiting Binga and celebrating the opening of the newly built Zubo offices. However, as a Tonga woman myself, I was very disappointed to see that the name of the director of Zubo not spelt correctly. It is Cumanzala and not Chumanzala as the name is Tonga and not Shona. Then there is the disappointing trend of addressing women from Binga district: “Binga women.” As a Tonga woman from Binga, I speak for many when I say that we do not like this title or the negative connotations it is intended to uphold for readers. I know this is a big ask as the secondary purpose of a newspaper is to make money, but we would greatly appreciate not being labelled as “Binga women” but maybe “Tonga women” or the more inclusive “women in Binga.” Thank you for considering my letter. I hope you will correct her name at least and take note of how the phrasing of the identity of Tonga women continues to perpetuate the stereotypes already upheld in our country. Concerned Tonga woman
