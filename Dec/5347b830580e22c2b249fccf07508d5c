The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter DRILL Hall Police Station in Bulawayo will today host the Zimbabwe Karate Union (ZKU) Champion of Champions Karate Tournament set to attract top Karatekas from across the country. A strong field of contestants is expected to feature at the tournament with some of the biggest names in different Karate styles participating in the annual national event. The tournament is one of the events which the ZKU uses to select individuals who constitute the national squad in two categories, kata (forms) and Kumite (fighting). BMKA technical director Ndabezinhle Mazibuko said all was in place ahead of the competition. “It’s all systems go ahead of this big event. Yesterday evening we had a referees and judges’ seminar to refresh our officials and make sure that the officiating is on point. We are expecting a good number of athletes in this competition. Such events help us select national teams,” said Mazibuko. The tournament provides an opportunity for athletes to showcase their skills and gives them an opportunity to impress the national selection panel. Admission for spectators is free. Karate is one sporting discipline in Zimbabwe that has endured a lot of financial misfortunes as athletes end up paying for themselves to participate in competitions. – @innocentskizoe
