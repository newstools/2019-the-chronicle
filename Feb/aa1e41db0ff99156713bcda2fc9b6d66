PRESIDENT Mnangagwa’s decision to set up a 26-member Presidential Advisory Council (PAC), has been hailed by industrialists and political analysts as a potentially game-changing move as it gives him more “eyes, ears and consequently invaluable intelligence,” on what will be happening on the ground. The PAC was established principally to advise and assist President Mnangagwa in formulating key economic policies and strategies that push Vision 2030, which seeks to make the country an upper middle-income country with a per capita income of between $3 896 and $12 055. Highly respected individuals who include United Refineries Limited (URL) chief executive officer Mr Busisa Moyo and former Delta Corporation CEO Mr Joe Mtizwa, are part of the star-studded team. <img class=" wp-image-420388" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Busisa-Moyo-address-conference-360x187.jpg" alt="" width="784" height="407" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Busisa-Moyo-address-conference-360x187.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Busisa-Moyo-address-conference.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /> Mr Busisa Moyo The establishment of the PAC was one of the recommendations made by businesspeople when they met President Mnangagwa at State House last year. <img class=" wp-image-435352" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Joe-Mtizwa-360x238.jpg" alt="" width="782" height="517" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Joe-Mtizwa-360x238.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/Joe-Mtizwa.jpg 674w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /> Dr Joe Mtizwa Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) president Mr Sifelani Jabangwe, told our Harare Bureau yesterday the coming in of the PAC was long overdue. “We are quite happy that they have put it in place. We are also happy with the people that were selected into this Council because they are credible, and will be equal to the task at hand,” said Mr Jabangwe. “We should start to make use of them so that they help in transforming the economy. We have always wanted to have something like this, which advises the Presidium on issues affecting business. “It is our hope that the role of this Council will be to synthesize the recommendations that will be coming from business organisations (such as CZI and ZNCC), and to improve policy formulation and implementation. Mr Jabangwe said his only concern was that the PAC “does not have a representative from the construction sector”, which is critical to economic growth. Industrialist and former Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce president Mr Davison Norupiri also said; “It is a very good idea by the President to have a team of businesspeople that he works with. One good thing about the Council is that the President included people from almost every sector of the economy. “As a businessman, I am happy with the Council and I am positive that this will be a game-changer for the country’s economy as it (PAC) will definitely take us to the next level in terms of economic turnaround, and I see Vision 2030 being achieved.” Economist Mr Persistence Gwanyanya said the appointment of the PAC “resonates well with standard global practices”. “It is a progressive move because it allows him to have more eyes, ears as well as intelligence on the ground. This is important to broaden and deepen the Executive’s understanding of issues so as to engage the policymakers from a more informed and conscious position. “As a President, you should always understand the priorities of time and treat them deservedly. Now the President will be in a position to question some of the proposals and happenings in Government from a more informed and balanced position. “Some policies need to be questioned from a more neutral and well informed position,” said Mr Gwanyanya. Political analyst Mr Richard Mahomva believes the appointment of the PAC reaffirms President Mnangagwa’s leadership’s commitment to achieve sustainable economic development. Mr Mahomva said the initiative is critical as it helps in the “collective generation of ideas” that add value to the re-tooling of industry, product value addition, job creation, social cohesion and integration. “At large, the PAC symbolises a strategic and perennial model for national dialogue beyond the narrow peddled propositions for black-mailing national dialogue by some civic society groups,” said Mr Mahomva. He added that the PAC will form the much-needed systemic path for national dialogue as it is comprised of multi-sectoral heads of key socio-economic groupings in the country. “The effectiveness of this body will be noted through fast-tracked policy-continuities and discontinuities aimed at advancing national interest,” said Mr Mahomva. Another political analyst Mr Godwine Mureriwa, said the establishment of the PAC was noble as it showed the President was an open leader willing to engage in dialogue for the development of the nation. “The establishment of the PAC will unite people, establish a common vision for national development. This is a diverse body with people of diverse backgrounds and diverse skills. “By appointing the PAC, the President has confirmed that Zimbabwe does not belong to him but to Zimbabweans. He has always said that the party is bigger to accommodate everyone but it cannot fit into an individual’s pocket. “The appointment of the PAC is a manifestation of a servant leadership. Zimbabweans should give him advice. He is walking his talk. He is the representative of Zimbabwe. He is open and he even tolerates people who are rude to him on his Twitter account,” said Mr Mureriwa. But Construction Industry Federation of Zimbabwe (Cifoz) chief executive Mr Martin Chingaira, bemoaned the absence of representatives from his sector. “We are not in this Council and I do not know how people are expected to hear issues pertaining to construction sector when we are not represented. “The construction industry is the barometer for every economy. Remember, infrastructure is key in every sector of the economy, be it the mining sector or farming sector, you need infrastructure. “So I thought if we were in the PAC we were going to advance the interests of the sector,” said Mr Chingaira.
