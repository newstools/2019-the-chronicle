He stole a Samsung galaxy, Mobicel Trend, HOM, a Mint handset and a Vodafone as well as a brown handbag and satchel which belonged to the church members. He proceeded to Lupinyu where he was later caught leading to recovery of four cellphones,” said Ms Daka. Some members of the Johanne Masowe church testified in court. “After we noticed that some of our things were missing, we followed the footprints from the shrine to the main tarred road where we spotted the accused waiting for transport while carrying a brown satchel. He boarded a car which dropped him at Lupinyu where we later found him,” said one of the church Mr Mlibazisi Shoko. A detective who was at Lupinyu Business Centre arrested Mthethwa.
