A ZIMBABWEAN national who killed his fellow countryman at Gift Amuli and Allan Ndoda’s show at Hillbrow Theatre in Johannesburg two years ago, was on Tuesday sentenced to an effective 30 years in jail by the High Court in Johannesburg. Milton Ncube opened fire into the crowd during the show, a double album launch, in August 2017 after claiming to have misplaced his mobile phone. He killed a reveller and injured many others in the skirmishes. The deceased, Percy Ncube (then 26), from Plumtree, was subsequently buried with the assistance of show promoter Phakama Nkomo “PK” who, through his company, promised to take care of the deceased’s family. The Outreach Foundation, which is responsible for the affairs of Hillbrow Theatre through their theatre manager, Gerald Bester, said they were elated by the Johannesburg High Court ruling. “As this tragic chapter comes to a close, the theatre team and the Outreach Foundation would like to again thank and acknowledge all who have supported and cared for those affected by this tragic incident,” said Bester.
