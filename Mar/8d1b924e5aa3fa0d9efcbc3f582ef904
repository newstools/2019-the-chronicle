The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FIVE Games’ Villages have been identified for the upcoming National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) track and field competitions that will take place at Midlands Christian College in Gweru from March 25-27. The meet is a culmination of schools’ athletics competitions that started with inter-house competitions at all schools to inter-district events that saw all 10 provinces selecting provincial teams for next week’s tournament. According to Nash acting president Arthur Maphosa, the identified villages are Chaplin High School that will house Midlands and Bulawayo provinces, Matabeleland South and Masvingo provinces will be at Fletcher High School, Mashonaland Central and Manicaland provinces will put up at Nashville High School, Mashonaland West and Harare provinces have been allocated Thornhill High School, while Matabeleland North and Mashonaland East provinces will use Mkoba 3 High School. “As you know these games will be used to select Team Zimbabwe for the Confederation of Schools Sport Associations of Southern Africa (Cossasa) championships that will be hosted by Swaziland from May 2-5 where we will be taking the Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 age groups,” said Maphosa, who is also the Gwanda High School headmaster. For the second year running, the meet will be held jointly with the primary schools’ competitions to create a sense of oneness among teachers and pupils. Nash will observe a minute of silence before the start of the competitions in memory of victims of the devastating Cyclone Idai that caused dozens of deaths and destruction in Manicaland province and some parts of Masvingo. The schools have also been directly affected following the death of Chipinge head-in-charge of athletics Claudius Rumbwere, who drowned with his entire family last week. “As schools we are still grieving and were badly affected. We will thus observe a minute of silence in honour of the victims of this cyclone which has ravaged our nation,” said Maphosa.
