MAPHISA Athletics Club athletes are dominating the inter-zonal competitions taking place at St Sebastian Secondary School. The competitions started on Thursday and will run until today. The Maphisa Athletics Club was established last year and seeks to engage local schools and provide them with a platform for talented athletes to train throughout the year as well as to help raise funds to cater for their expenses. Six athletes from the club are representing various schools at the Matobo South district event in different track and field competitions. Bokani Ndlovu, who is the club’s president, said the performance by the youngsters gives them a reason to ensure that they are given everything they need in their quest to become professional athletes. The athletes have so far claimed a total of 18 medals among themselves, 15 of them being gold and three silver medals. Tilda Ndebele made the mark after claiming four gold medals in long jump, high jump, 100m and 200m hurdles in the Under-15 girls category. Sibongumusa Moyo, Brilliance Matsheza, Eustine Moyo, Getrude Dube and Fortune Ngwenya are the other athletes under Maphisa Athletics Club who made sure their presence was felt. “These kids are doing something extraordinary and it’s high time we as the community rise up to the occasion and help them achieve their dream. I will continue preaching the gospel of working as a team to lift these youngsters and ensure that they stay dedicated to the cause,” said Ndlovu. The club is also credited with producing Elizabeth Ndlovu who has been selected to participate in the 3 000m African Junior Championship to be held in Côte d’Ivoire next month. — @DecoDecent2
