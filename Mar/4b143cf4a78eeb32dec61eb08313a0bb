The Chronicle Editor – The Passengers’ Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) learned with sorrow about the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Flight 302, which was on a scheduled flight to Nairobi, Kenya, on Sunday March 10 that led to 157 passengers and crew members’ loss of life. PAZ board and members express their deepest condolences to the Ethiopian and Kenyan governments, all nations that had citizens on board and the families that have lost their loved ones. Our compassion and solidarity is with all those who are going through grief. We hope that the cause of the crash will soon be known and any cited safety issues addressed in the interest of preventing such tragedies in the future. – PAZ Response to “Ramaphosa wants sanctions gone”. It is very encouraging that African leaders, Sadc leaders in particular, are all giving the Zimbabwean leader support against the satanic sanctions. This speaks volumes against Nelson Chamisa whose diplomatic image now stinks all the way to the AU corridors in Addis Ababa. No Zimbabwean leader should enjoy supporting sanctions that economically hurt the majority of poor Zimbabweans. — Cde Mzvinavhu (Prof)
