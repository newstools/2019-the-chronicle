The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent BIGGER and better is what was promised and this was what was delivered during the Roil Bulawayo Arts Awards held at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre on Saturday evening. <img class="alignnone wp-image-455648" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0426-360x212.png" alt="" width="671" height="395" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0426-360x212.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0426.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /> Touted as the biggest dress up event in the city, the who’s who in Bulawayo came out in droves wearing outlandish, jaw dropping and statement making outfits and brought the city to a standstill. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-455668" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/0M9A0340-360x201.png" alt="" width="672" height="375" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/0M9A0340-360x200.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/0M9A0340.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /> The red carpet was the centre of attraction where the fashion police scrutinised what each person was wearing. <img class="alignnone wp-image-455649" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0473-360x201.png" alt="" width="670" height="374" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0473-360x200.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0473.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /> However, this was a precursor of what was going to happen during the night. The huge venue, although not filled to the brim, was teeming with excitement and great performances on stage. Artistes in their varied ensembles and individually never put a foot wrong as they made it their mission to entertain the crowd. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-455666" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/0M9A0483-360x201.png" alt="" width="670" height="374" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/0M9A0483-360x200.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/0M9A0483.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /> The awards were graced by the Minister of Industry and Commerce Mangaliso Ndlovu, National Arts Council of Zimbabwe chairperson Nicholas Moyo and United Refineries CEO Busisa Moyo among other dignitaries. <img class="alignnone wp-image-455650" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0435-360x201.png" alt="" width="672" height="375" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0435-360x200.png 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/06/0M9A0435.png 680w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /> On the winners front, the highlight was Novuyo-Seagirl who won Song of the Year for her track AEIOU and Outstanding Female Artiste, while Iyasa made a clean sweep of the dance awards winning the Outstanding Male dancer, Female dancer and Arts ensemble award.
