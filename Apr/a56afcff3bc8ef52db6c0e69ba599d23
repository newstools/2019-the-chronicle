The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent IMBUBE outfit, Indosakusa: The Morning Star will on Friday launch their second album at an event that is being funded by their fans. The launch of the Gospel Volume 2: Siyadumisa album will be at the Bulawayo Theatre and will start at 5PM. Supporting the group will be Umkhankaso Wamajaha, Umkhonto Ovuthayo, Sisters of Paradise, Zion Choristers and Gaz’elimnyama. Indosakusa: The Morning Star Fans, a group which was established on March 1 this year, said as fans of the imbube outfit, they had decided to sponsor the launch in order to support their favourite group. “We understand musicians, especially those from our region, have financial troubles so we decided to chip in by funding the album launch,” said Cindy Mulelo, The Morning Star Fans’ treasurer. She said members of the fan group pay monthly subscriptions which they will use for the album launch and other projects. “There’s a RTGS$10 joining fee and $3 monthly subscription fee which our members pay. With this money, we decided to do projects to support Indosakusa with their marketing by printing branded T-shirts and caps which we also sold. “The funds we have now, we’re using to pay for the venue, PA system and all the costs that are involved in the album launch,” said Mulelo. Indonsakusa leader Oscar Siziba thanked their fans for rendering support. “We’re grateful to the fans that have come out to pay for the venue and PA system. Without them, we weren’t going to be able to host this launch,” he said. Siziba said the new album was a praise offering to God for all he has done for the group.
