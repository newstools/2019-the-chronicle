The Chronicle Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A JEALOUS man from Bulawayo allegedly severely beat up a man he found talking to his ex-girlfriend and also assaulted her brother with a knobkerrie until he fell unconscious. Fidelis Mpofu of Nkulumane 5 suburb assaulted Mr Nqobile Mpofu who was talking to his ex-girlfriend Ms Sinqobile Ncube and went on to hit her brother Mr Naphtal Ncube. He appeared before Western Commonage regional magistrate Mrs Sibongile Marondedze facing one count of attempted murder, one count of malicious damage to property and one count of assault. Mpofu pleaded not guilty and was remanded in custody to July 1 for trial. He said he got angry when Ms Ncube and her brother refused to let him see his child. “When I jumped into the yard, l was intending to talk to Ms Ncube so that she lets me see our child but she had locked herself in the house. Her brother came out and l tried talking to him but he became very rude and aggressive to the extent that we exchanged insults,” Mpofu said. Prosecuting, Ms Samantha Gubede said on April 2 at around 8:30PM, Fidelis saw Mr Mpofu standing with his ex-girlfriend and that did not go down well with him. “He asked the two why they were together but did not get a satisfactory answer. He assaulted Mr Mpofu with a brick on the head and on the left arm. “Mr Mpofu and Ms Ncube ran away in fear. Fidelis jumped over the precast wall into Ms Ncube’s home and threw stones at the windows and doors,” she said. Ms Gubede said when Mr Ncube heard the stones hitting the windows, he woke up to see what was happening. Fidelis attacked him with a knobkerrie until he fell unconscious.  Mr Ncube was ferried to Mpilo Hospital where he was admitted while Mr Mpofu sought medication at the same hospital. The matter was reported to the police and medical reports were produced in court. — @LissahMangena.
