The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter FORMER Highlanders’ captain Honest Moyo has finally received his international reverse clearance certificate and has already played two games for his new paymasters TS Sporting in the South African National First Division. Moyo parted ways with the Bulawayo giants after his contract expired at the end of last season and joined the great trek to South Africa as a free agent despite many years of service at Highlanders where he started as a junior player, graduating to the first team. He is one of many stars from Highlanders that have gone for free despite cutting their footballing teeth at the institution. “My clearance finally came and as it is, I have already played two games now and I am enjoying life here,” said Moyo from his base in Mpumalanga province. Moyo was in the team that played and lost 0-2 to former Absa Premiership side Ajax Cape Town, but they got their act together over the weekend to beat Witbank by the same scoreline. The former Bosso skipper now plays alongside former Dynamos defender Blessing Moyo and is one of three former Highlanders’ players plying their trade in the second tier league. King Nadolo and Cleopas Dube are with struggling Witbank. Having been part of Sunday Chidzambwa’s Cosafa winning squad of 2017 in South Africa, Moyo was heavily tipped to join an Absa Premiership club, but the deal fell through, while his starting jersey at Bosso was also no longer guaranteed as the technical team preferred the young Mbongeni Ndlovu. Despite no longer commanding a starting jersey at Bosso, Moyo remained captain of the club until his unexpected exit as a free agent and his destination remained unknown until Chronicle Sport tracked him to TS Sporting.
