The Chronicle CAIRO (Reuters) – Former Egyptian president Mohamed Mursi has died in court, state television reported yesterday. It said Mursi had fainted after a court session and died afterwards. Mursi, a top figure in the Muslim Brotherhood, was toppled by the military in 2013 after mass protests against this rule. He had been serving a seven-year sentence for falsifying his candidacy application for the 2012 presidential race. Meanwhile, Algerian former prime minister Ahmed Ouyahia appeared in a court in Algiers on Sunday to be questioned over alleged corruption involving the partner in Algeria of Germany’s Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), state TV said. This is the second time Ouyahia has been questioned since the Supreme Court last week ordered his detention as part of another investigation into alleged corruption. —Reuters.
