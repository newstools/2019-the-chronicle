CHICKEN Inn captain, Moses Jackson, believes his club now has players that are prepared to die on the pitch in challenging for the 2019 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title. Speaking just before the Gamecocks’ departure for a pre-season invitational tournament in Malawi yesterday, Jackson said he believes this could just be their year. “We are happy to be afforded a great opportunity to bond and work on our different combinations in Malawi. We are not going there for holiday, but mean serious business and be consistent to win the 2019 championship,” said Jackson The Gamecocks finished third on the Premiership in 2018, a massive 21 points behind back-to-back champions FC Platinum. At one point during last year’s championship, it looked like Chicken Inn were one of the few sides that could hamper FC Platinum’s defence of their title. Chicken Inn has added goalkeeper Donovan Bernard, defensive midfielder Tinashe Chipunza and striker Clive Augusto. Bret Amidu has also switched base to the Gamecocks alongside winger Malvin Gaki, the former Dynamos trio of right-back Phakamani Dube and attackers Valentine Kadonzvo and Panashe Mutasa. All the Gamecocks’ new signings are part of the 27-man squad that left for Malawi yesterday.
