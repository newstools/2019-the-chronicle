The Chronicle Raymond Jaravaza, Sports Correspondent VISITING Mainline FC and Indlovu Iyanyathela played a goalless draw in a Zifa Southern Region match played at Mzilikazi Barracks on Saturday. The 2019 Zifa Southern Region season kicked off last week and all 18 teams have each played two games to date. Indlovu Iyanyathela have collected four points after dismissing Ajax Hotspurs 3-1 in their opening match of the season. Mainline opened their campaign with a 1-2 loss to Bosso90 in Plumtree last week. Mainline failed to capitalise on their extra man advantage after Indlovu Iyanyathela’s Alfred Mehlomakhulu was shown a red card for a crude tackle in the 72nd minute. With an uninspiring first half where both teams failed to create clear cut scoring opportunities, both coaches appeared to have resigned themselves to sharing the spoils. Indlovu Iyanyathela coach Clemence Chimimba blamed his players for failing to stick to the game plan for the better part of the game. “Mainline players are tall and strong so I told the guys before the match to keep the ball on the ground, but they kept on doing the exact opposite; pumping the ball into the air. “It’s frustrating when players don’t stick to the game plan. “It’s surprising how they started playing good football when we had already lost Alfred through a red card, but it was way too late,” said Chimimba. He said his target is to win at least six matches in the first 10 games of the season and ultimately a top four finish at the end of the season. Mainline coach Siza Mguni, holding fort for veteran gaffer Paul Moyo who is currently in South Africa, said taking home a point was a fair result for his charges. “It’s never easy coming here to Indlovu Iyanyathela and getting a draw, so I think it was a fair result for the players, although it would have been great to snatch a win,” said Mguni. — @RaymondJaravaza
