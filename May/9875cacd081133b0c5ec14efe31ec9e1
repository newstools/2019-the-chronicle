The Chronicle Response to “Chief Ndiweni caught offside in land wrangle”. His father, together with Chief Chirau were big sell-outs during the liberation struggle, it’s in his blood. – Chirau. Response to “Prof Ncube beams light on economy”. We are in safe hands with Prof Mthuli. Economy was damaged for 20 years, so we can’t expect miracles to happen in less than a year’s time. The damage started at the birth of MDC. The coming of the MDC brought suffering to Zimbabweans, and it’s a fact. The time you so much cherish that things were alright this was the period 1998 going backwards. These were happier times because there was no MDC. The MDC is associated with suffering, economic meltdown, sanctions, embargos, you name it. – Chirandu. Response to “Dialogue is forever”. Those who think Chamisa has a hidden magical wand or political key to our economic problems stand disabused from their folly. His casus belli with the elected government is not over the overall winning of Zanu-PF two thirds majority in Parliament. But his disputing the presidential result, an issue legally settled constitutionally by the Concourt. Those who think he has the key or clout to solve our economic problems assume that, being a stooge of the West, the West would quickly pour into Zimbabwe foreign currency and investments if he were to be given governing power, despite losing elections. Chamisa thinks that what is stopping the removal of satanic sanctions is his absence from Zimbabwe’s State House after losing our free and fair elections. Why should our nation be subjected to such unconstitutional Western political machinations? When we fought for freedom from Western colonial rule, is that what we died for? Why does our “freed from colonial rule” young Chamisa appear to buy that nonsense? T he national dialogue should forecast on uniting all our national political leaders to denounce sanctions. — Cde Mzvinavhu (prof)
