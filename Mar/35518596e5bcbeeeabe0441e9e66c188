The Chronicle Leonard Ncube, Victoria Falls Reporter GOVERNMENT has allocated about $25 million to local authorities in Matabeleland North province to undertake infrastructure development projects. Matabeleland North has seven districts and 10 local authorities. Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister July Moyo told delegates during the Matabeleland North Devolution Conference in Lupane last Friday that the funds were provided for in the 2019 national budget. Minister Moyo said the funds are now available and will be used for road, sewer and water works as well as development of schools and health services. “Each local authority has been allocated five percent by the Minister of Finance and Economic Development. At the moment we are working on a criteria to use to distribute the money but we have found that the best way is to use the marginalisation index where those lagging behind in terms of development get more,” said Minister Moyo. He said there were options to use the population index and poverty assessment reports but these were set aside as they would have disadvantaged some needy areas. “This is five percent of this year’s budget and will be annual. Our hope is that the allocation will increase next year because budget is incremental,” he said. Minister Moyo said Victoria Falls Municipality will receive $1 467 642, Hwange Local Board will get $1 795 480 and $2 390 788 will be given to Hwange Rural District Council. Lupane Local Board and Kusile Rural District Council will receive $2 511 414 and $2 898 000. Umguza RDC’s share is $2 586 898, Tsholotsho will have $2 871 000 while Bubi and Nkayi RDCs will get $2 682 108 and $3 060 000. Binga RDC will get $3 029 000, the highest allocation in the province. Minister Moyo said Binga and Nkayi are the most marginalised districts in the province hence their needs surpass other areas. “We gave a significant amount to Lupane Local Board so that they can prepare to be a town while you will notice that Victoria Falls has the least because they are already better equipped. “We have done this because we believe our main duty is to look into marginalisation and build infrastructure in rural business centres,” said the Minister. —@ncubeleon
