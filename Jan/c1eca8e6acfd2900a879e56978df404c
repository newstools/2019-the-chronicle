BULAWAYO Metropolitan Cricket Association league games are set to resume this weekend following disturbances that rocked the city about a fortnight ago. Zimbabwe Cricket Bulawayo provincial administrator Nicholas Singo said all leagues, which include the First, Second and Third, will resume on Saturday. The games were meant to resume last week, but civil disturbances forced the association to push back the kick-off by a week. “We were delayed by demonstrations that took place last week and the scarcity of fuel. “The disturbances affected our pitches because there was no one watering them,” said Singo. He said despite the league’s resumption, they still had no sponsor, although a number of corporates committed to sponsoring them. Singo said infrastructure has improved significantly in Bulawayo after it was refurbished for hosting of the ICC World Cup qualifiers last year. Emakhandeni 2 will entertain Queens Cricket Club 2 in one of the Lwague Two games at Queens Sports Club, while Nketa Cricket Club faces Gampu Lions in the other match at the same venue. At the Heath Streak Cricket Academy, Nust will take on fellow varsity boys Lupane State University on Saturday. The match between Champions and Glenkara at Bulawayo Athletic Club will kick-off League Three games followed by BAC 2 against Cheetahs at the same venue, while ZRP face Bulawayo Polytechnic. Queens Cricket Club welcomes Emakhandeni Cricket Club in League One at Queens Sports Club, with Roosters meeting Bulawayo Athletic Club 1 at BAC. The league is expected to end in mid-April. — @DecoDecent2
