THE Veterinary Services Department has warned farmers of a potential swine fever outbreak following reported cases of the epidemic in Manicaland province. In a press statement the Veterinary Services said a fever outbreak has been detected in free-range pigs in Nyamaropa and Nyakomba areas in Manicaland Province. “The communiqué serves to notify all our stakeholders of a suspected African swine fever outbreak in free-range pigs in Nyamaropa and Nyakomba areas in Nyanga North, Manicaland province,” reads part of the statement. The Veterinary Services said farmers in the area reported that the deaths of pigs began during the last week of January 2019 and as of February 7, when the provincial veterinary officer for Manicaland province visited the area, a total of 156 deaths had been recorded out of an estimated population of 678 pigs. An autopsy conducted on a pig, which had died on the same day of the visit revealed post mortem lesions consistent with African swine fever, said the Veterinary Services. “African swine fever is a highly contagious haemorrhagic viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, which is responsible for serious economic and production losses,” reads part of the statement. “It is a transboundary animal disease, which can be spread by live or dead pigs, domestic or wild and pork products. There is no approved vaccine against African swine fever.” The Veterinary Services advised the Pig Industry Board (PIB), Pig Producers’ Association of Zimbabwe (PPAZ) and pig farmers to intensify bio-security measures around their pig establishments and help with countrywide African swine fever awareness campaigns. Veterinary Services is mandated to transform the livestock sector to attain sustainably high levels of production, processing and marketing in order to improve livelihoods and meet the needs of human nutritional wellness and economic growth. — @queentauruszw.
