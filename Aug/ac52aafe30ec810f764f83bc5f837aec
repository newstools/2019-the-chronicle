The Chronicle Editor: The Honda Fit pirate taxis are a nuisance.They not add value to any sector of the economy. lllegality is their pride, siphoning money from citizens. These do not pay anything to Council, Ministry of Transport, Zimra etc yet they ignorantly complain of potholes.They do not have insurance cover. Of late, they are the agency of the spate of rape and robberies. So there we are. Government must act on Honda Fits transporting people at exorbitant fares without justification. They have no cost outlays. Register them or do away with them once and for all. Concerned Citizen Bulawayo
