The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter SIX teams will battle it out in the Biya and Friends Under-15 football tournament set for Luveve Stadium B Arena this morning. The tournament will see Highlanders, FMSA Umguza, Biya and Friends Academy as well as Gwabalanda, taking part in the competition. Not sidelining the girl child, Highlanders Royals will face Biya and Friends in the women’s division. The tournament is a brain child of former Warriors and Highlanders defender Thulani “Biya” Ncube. Ncube, whose football-playing career was shortened by a nagging knee injury, is one of the country’s former footballers who are on a quest to develop young players, with emphasis on education. Biya, as he Ncube is affectionately known by football fans across the country, has managed to mobilise his contacts to support children with a passion of playing football. His academy seeks to keep boys as well as girls away from the streets by making sure that they stick to sharpening their football skills on the field of play. Initially, the project started with a focus on boys but the girl child has been taken on board as well. This is in recognition of the challenges that affect them when growing up. The academy is also paying school fees for the players to make sure that they strike a balance between their academic and football career. – @innocentskizoe
