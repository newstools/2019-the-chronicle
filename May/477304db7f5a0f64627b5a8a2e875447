The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma FUN lovers in Gweru are in for a rare treat this weekend with an array of potentially explosive gigs lined up across the city. It has been long since Gweru had such a jam-packed weekend and no serious fun lover in the city will want to miss out on this one. Kicking off festivities will be Msindo Family who will be hosting an afternoon chillout session with wrestlers at Barnah Gardens (Along Harare-Bulawayo highway) today. The family fun show is set to draw young crowds who will be partying for the last time as schools are opening next week. During the show, there will be a battle of local DJs which will be headlined by Double O Seven. “The young generation has in the past, felt short-changed because of events which only cater for the mature generation. To try and solve this, we’ve decided to have this fun day that will run concurrently with the wrestling matches. “There’ll be 20 professional wrestlers from the Zimbabwe Wrestling Federation who’ll entertain the crowd as they battle it out,” event organiser, MC Jah Soshea said. The event, which has become the talk of the city, will be hosted by Zimboy with performances from artistes Xxido, Ras Mega, Lewa Skatta, Jah Juicy and Mark Man. From here, all roads will lead to Club Excite where rapper ExQ will headline the Chillout Session after-party in the evening. The Nzenza hit-maker will perform alongside Military Touch Movement DJ Tamuka, Zimdancehall sensational Bazooker, Nutty O and DJ Crocx. DJ Crocx said all was in place for the event with ExQ expected to arrive in the afternoon. “Last time we hosted ExQ, things didn’t go down very well. We’ve however, learnt from those mistakes and patrons should expect a better organised event.” — @mthabisi_mthire.
