A MAN from Bulawayo lost his vehicle to a thief while drinking beer at a city sports bar. Mr Simon Kwanai (39) of Nketa 9 suburb parked his car, a Nissan Liberty registration number ACD 4453, outside Choppies Bellevue Sports Bar and went inside for a beer drink. He forgot to remove the car keys from the ignition port. Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya heard this when Blessmore Tinashe Mahachi (19) of Emganwini suburb appeared before him facing a charge of theft of a motor vehicle. He was remanded in custody to today for trial. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said on December 15 last year at around 11PM, Mr Kwanai parked his car outside Choppies Bellevue Sports Bar and went inside for a beerdrink. He however, forgot to remove the keys from the ignition. “The complainant secured his car by closing all windows and doors before he left car keys on the ignition port,” said Mr Mageza. The court heard that Mahachi approached the unattended car and opened the unlocked doors. He started the car engine and drove off unnoticed. When Mr Kwanai returned to the parking lot he discovered that his car was not there. He then went to Donnington Police Station where he reported the matter to the police. Three days later, detectives from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Vehicle Theft Squad section received a tip off and they made a follow up leading to the arrest of Mahachi and subsequent recovery of the stolen vehicle. “On December 18, detectives from the CID Vehicle Theft Squad section received information and made a follow up leading to the arrest of the accused person,” said Mr Mageza. The car was found parked at a bar in Old Pumula suburb and the owner managed to positively identify it. – @mashnets
