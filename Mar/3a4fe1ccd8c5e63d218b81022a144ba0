The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Chronicle Reporter A 41-YEAR- OLD man from Bulawayo’s Iminyela suburb allegedly axed his tenant (70) and committed suicide thinking that he had killed the elderly man. Sifiso Mhlanga who was suspected to be drunk allegedly struck the tenant, only identified as Mr Sibanda once on the head on Wednesday around 9PM. Neighbours said when Mhlanga saw Mr Sibanda’s bloodied body, he thought he was dead and went on to hang himself from the roof trusses of his bedroom using a piece of rope. He allegedly left a suicide note next to the axe, which was covered with blood. Neighbours who had gathered outside saw blood flowing under the door and broke it down to gain entry. They found Mhlanga dead and Mr Sibanda unconscious. They called an ambulance and informed the police. Mr Sibanda was yesterday said to be recovering at Mpilo Central Hospital. Sources said the two had a misunderstanding over an unknown issue. Mr Kelvin Matore (28), a neighbour  said he heard the two fighting for about 30 minutes. “I heard some noise around 9PM and the deceased sounded drunk. I rushed to their house but the door was locked,” said Mr Matore. Ms Lucy Mhlanga (63), Mhlanga’s sister, said her brother tended to be violent when drunk. “Sifiso is uncontrollable when he is drunk and I was not surprised when I received the news,” she said. “Mhlanga left a suicide note and placed it on top of the cupboard together with the blood stained axe saying he had killed his tenant because he had disrespected him.” “Sengiyibulele inyanga yenu (I have killed your witchdoctor,” he allegedly wrote. Mhlanga’s body was ferried to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) for post mortem. Bulawayo Police Spokesperson Chief Inspector Precious Simango said investigations into the issue were underway. —@sharonbuwe
