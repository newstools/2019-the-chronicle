We have been preparing for the tournament since last year. We are positive that it is going to be very exciting. “Karatekas from Masvingo, Triangle, Marondera, Bulawayo and Harare have confirmed their participation,” said Ziwira. Top karatekas expected at the event include the Manyeruke brothers; Thomas, Kenny and Tamuka Ziwira, Julias Dzikiti, Dean Ramsey and Innocent Ntini who are set to battle it out in the senior male categories. In the junior boys category the likes of Lloyd takana, Lovemore Mutune and Mc Evans Kadenhe will battle for the top prize.
