The Bill will be gazetted this Friday. It will go before Parliament; it should go next week and legislative process will then commence.” Officially commissioning the fifth specialised anti-corruption court in the country in Gweru on Friday, Minister Ziyambi said corruption was hitting the poor mostly since they cannot pay bribes. “As Minister in charge of the administration of justice, I take immense pride in that all these institutions have fully embraced His Excellency, the President of Zimbabwe’s clarion call for a corruption free Zimbabwe in order for the country to attract increased Foreign Direct Investment,” he said.
