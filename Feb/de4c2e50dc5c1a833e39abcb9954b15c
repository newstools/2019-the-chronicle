PREMIERSHIP football returnees Hwange have signed Ghanaian defender Kwadoh Appiah with coach Nation Dube confident he will strengthen their defence and boost their quest to survive the chop. The 22-year-old Appiah was snatched from Ghana League Two side Thunderbolt, he side he played for in the 2017-18 season. Club chairman, Butholezwe Dube, could not divulge much on the player as he said they were still working on team registration. He told our sister paper, The Herald, that the full squad will be unveiled next week. “We completed building our 2019 season squad and it has some new players from our neighbouring countries but it will be the best for us to announce them all next week when we unveil them to our stakeholders, especially our community and fans,’’ he said. “But we are ready for the season, our pre-season training started well and we got our targeted players on time.’’ The coach said he has built a competitive side. “We retained most of our players who helped us get promoted again into the top-flight league,’’ said Dube. “We didn’t go for high-profile names but we signed young players who are passionate about playing football. “We believe that, with the help and guidance of our experienced players like Gilbert Zulu, all our new signings will be able to quickly adapt to the club’s philosophy and type of play.’’
