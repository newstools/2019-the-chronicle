The Chronicle A union has defended a teacher after a pupil “looking for trouble” said it was not scientifically possible to have more than two genders. The boy (17) secretly filmed the moment he was reprimanded by the teacher (56) at a school in Aberdeenshire. In the video the boy can be heard saying “I think it’s silly to have anything other than two genders, sir”. The teacher tells him that he should keep his opinion to himself and reminds him that the school where the footage was shot is an inclusive one. The boy challenged the teacher after he was kicked out of class and he was given reasons why. The teacher told him “you’re entitled to your opinion”, but the teenager asked: “If I am, then why did you kick me out of class? It’s not very inclusive.” Aberdeenshire Council said that the video did not show the full context of the incident. They said the school supported a “fairer, inclusive environment for all”. The boy has been reprimanded for posting the video without consent after the video was shared online last Friday. General Secretary of the Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association Seamus Searson said: “This sounds like a youngster looking for trouble.” A council spokesman added: “As part of our Public Sector Equality Duty we aim to: eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation; advance equality of opportunity between those who have protected characteristics and those who don’t; and foster good relations between those who have protected characteristics and those who don’t. “It is important to understand the context of any video clip taken without a person’s consent. “In our schools, fostering good relations among different groups can be a real challenge but our aim is to support a fairer, inclusive environment for all.” – The Mirror
