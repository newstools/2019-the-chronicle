The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent HOUSE DJ Skaiva is delighted to be sharing the stage with ExQ, an artiste who he worked with on his Nama winning Tseu Tseu album. DJ Skaiva produced one of the songs titled Uyangihlanyisa on ExQ’s Tseu Tseu album which won the Outstanding Album award at this year’s Namas. The Bulawayo DJ said he is ready to rock the crowd at Queens Sports Club tomorrow and hopes to perform the Uyangihlanyisa song with ExQ. “I worked with ExQ on the song Uyangihlanyisa but we haven’t performed the song together. I really hope we’ll do so during the shutdown show,” said DJ Skaiva. He promised to take house music lovers on a house journey they will enjoy at the ZITF Shutdown show. “During my set, I want to play local house music and mix it with a bit of Gqom. My set will, however, be mostly afro-house which they crowd can dance to.” Turning to his career, DJ Skaiva said he likely will not be producing an album this year as his computer, where he had stored his beats, crashed. “This year, I wanted to release an album, but my computer crashed and I lost all of my beats and music that I was working on. So I had to start all over again. “I’m now in the process of making new beats,” he said. At the ZITF shutdown gig, DJ Skaiva will also share the stage with Winky D, Jah Prayzah, Novuyo Seagirl, Takura, DJ Nospa and Sungura Masters.
