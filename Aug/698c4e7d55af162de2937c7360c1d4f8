The Chronicle Editor: My relative reported a rape case to a lady policewoman (name withheld)but the accused is still walking around the compound, no docket was opened after we reported the case. Our lovely Magwegwe Officer in Charge, please come to our rescue, our relative is suffering. We need please justice. I know that justice delayed is not justice denied, but please consider the damage and also know the accused might run away and the case becomes invalid. Concerned Victim’s  relative, Magwegwe, Bulawayo
