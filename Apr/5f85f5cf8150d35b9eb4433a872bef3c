The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter AMBITIOUS Filabusi United have appointed former diminutive Highlanders and national team midfielder, Richard Choruma, as director of football in their endeavour to bring topflight football to the Matabeleland South district. The team will make its debut in the Zifa Central Region Division One League by taking on Kwekwe United on Sunday. “Yes, its true that Choruma is our director of football. As a rural-based team we want him to also link us to the outside world through his many contacts as an accomplished footballer who represented not only Highlanders but even the country,” said Filabusi United chief executive officer, Mkhululi Mthunzi. Choruma, who also played for Bloemfontein Celtic and Dynamos in South Africa, has many links in that country and in Europe. Mthunzi said their main objective was to stay afloat and survive relegation to keep the franchise alive in their debut season in the second tier league. “We want Filabusi United to be a shining beacon to the community. It must really be the team of choice and for that to be achieved we must survive relegation this year, but if the unthinkable happens and we get promoted, we will accept that gladly,” said Mthunzi. Nicknamed “Amalalandawonye”, the Division One debutants who have also made a flamboyant entry into the Twitter traffic, have registered 28 players for their campaign that will be led by coach Fakhosi Ndlovu, with Kevin Nyathi as club president and a lady, Sethu Dube, as secretary general. The team also got a timely boost ahead of the start of the season when Zifa’s First Instance Body homologated their home ground, Mthwakazi Stadium. “So the Filabusi home ground (Mthwakazi Stadium) was approved on Saturday by the Zifa grounds inspection team. This means our home games will be played koGodlwayo. A great season is upon us, we kick it off with an away match eKwekwe,” posted the club on its Facebook page.
