The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo allegedly axed his neighbour’s friend for disturbing his sleep by being noisy at around 5AM. Busungu Munenge (25) from Old Lobengula suburb allegedly went on to crash the “noisemaker” Mr Neverson Siyapeya (37)’s vehicle into a precast wall in an all-consuming rage. Mr Siyapeya sustained a deep cut on his forehead and was taken to Mpilo Central Hospital for treatment. Munenge pleaded not guilty to an attempted murder charge and malicious damage to property before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu. He was remanded out of custody on $200 bail to December 12 for continuation of trial. For the State, Mr Kenneth Shava said on October 14 this year at around 5AM, Munenge was asleep when Mr Siyapeya came shouting looking for his neighbour. “Munenge intentionally attempted to cause the death of Mr Siyapeya after he struck him once with an axe on his forehead during the misunderstanding. Munenge had no right to act in the manner he did,” he said. “The accused person went on to damage the complainant’s white Honda Fit.” Ms Nokuthula Zumba, who witnessed the incident, said Mr Siyapeya was noisy when he came looking for his friend. “Mr Siyapeya shouted at the top of his voice when he came looking for his friend. He ignored the accused person when he asked him to stop making noise. “The accused person got angry to an extent that he came out with an axe from his house and struck the complainant. “We immediately called for an ambulance as blood was gushing from the wounds,” she said. The matter was reported to the police leading to Munenge’s arrest.-@sharonbuwe
