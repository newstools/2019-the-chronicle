The Chronicle Kudzai Chikiwa, Chronicle Reporter THE Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) has cleared half of the RTGS $15 000 bill owed to Zesa by Entembeni Old People’s Home in Bulawayo. The old people’s home, which looks after 36 old people, has been failing to pay Zesa for five years. In an interview, IPEC public relations manager Mr Lloyd Gumbo said last year the commission pledged to clear half of the arrears. “After realising that the home was struggling with bills, IPEC paid $7 574.38 to Zesa which is 50 per cent of the total amount that Entembeni Old People’s Home owed to the power utility,” he said. Mr Gumbo said the commission came to know about Entembeni Old People’s Home’s plight through the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Labour and Social Welfare report prepared after the committee visited the home. “As a Commission, we believe in good corporate citizenship particularly to do with institutions that take care of the elderly. “We were moved by their plight after the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Labour and Social Welfare revealed the challenges the home faced including the high Zesa bill that the institution could not clear,” he said. Entembeni Old People’s Home board chairperson, Pastor Martin Chingombe, paid tribute to IPEC for their gesture. “We are very grateful for this kind of gesture shown by IPEC. “When they promised last year we were just holding on by faith and we are happy that they paid our arrears which are one of the most burdening expenses at this institution,” he said. Pastor Chingombe said the old people’s home still has some outstanding arrears which they are appealing for assistance to clear. “This home does not have a specific sponsor so you will see that most of the services we offer here are voluntary. “The financial burden becomes very heavy for us. That is why we have such huge arrears,” he said. – @tamary98.
