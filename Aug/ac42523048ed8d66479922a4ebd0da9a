The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE inaugural edition of the Zifa Bulawayo Province Cup gets underway on August 18 with 32 Division 2 and Division 3 teams set to battle for silverware. Tournament director Allan Ripper Mpofu said: “The teams pay affiliation fees and this is a way of giving back to the teams. At the end of the day this is their money that they pay to the league. This is the first edition of the competition and we hope it will be a successful one. We want to see the tournament growing bigger and better in future. “Seeing that we are already behind with our league schedules, we are not going to halt league action, but we will have teams playing this competition on Sundays. No team is going to pay referees, the association will cover that cost. The main idea is to have more people buying into this idea so that we have a bigger tournament next year.” Winners of the competition will walk away with $2 500.  Next Level Sports TV contributed $500 to that amount. Losing finalists will walk away with $1 000, while losing semi-finalists each get $500. Body Works Gym will sponsor prizes for the top goal scorer and player of the tournament.
