The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo ZIMBABWE General Medical Aid Fund has opened a fourth branch in Masvingo as part of an expansion drive targeting major cities across the country. Public relations and marketing manager, Mr Nyasha Gonese, said: “We have opened a new branch in Masvingo. This is the fourth branch in the country after we have opened others in Harare, Bulawayo and Gweru”. He said their package was unique in that every medical scheme that a person joins also caters for members’ funeral expenses. “Our schemes are unique in that if you pay for one service you will get another service for no extra payment. While our schemes cater for members’ medical bills, the same also overlaps to cover funeral cover and that is the uniqueness of the package,” said Mr Gonese. “Under the ZGMAF umbrella, we already have a funeral insurance, which provides free services if our member dies. The services are embedded in the medical insurance cover. We urge residents of Masvingo to join user-friendly medical aid schemes, which have value for money.” He said demand for insurance cover was high despite the subdued economic environment as many realise the importance of cover. – @walterbmswazie2
