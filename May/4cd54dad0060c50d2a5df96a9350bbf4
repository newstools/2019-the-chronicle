The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter RECLAIMING top spot in the Zifa Southern Region Division One League is Bulawayo City’s priority when they take on Ajax Hotspurs at Luveve Stadium this afternoon. City, who are second on the table with seven points from two games, were held to a goalless draw by newboys Binga Pirates in Binga last weekend, a result that saw them surrendering top spot to Talen Vision, who sit on nine points. The municipal side will be without head coach Try Ncube, who is attending a family bereavement in Zhombe, and Golding Dube and Johannes Ngodzo will bark instructions from the dugout in today’s encounter. Dube, who had a coaching stint in Swaziland, said his charges are fired up for Ajax. “Our preparations have been going on well and we’re ready for tomorrow’s game. We won’t underrate opponents because everyone in this league is a potential title contender that deserves our respect. What we simply want is to redeem ourselves from last weekend’s draw and get maximum points,” said Dube. City have arguably the best squad in the league capable of trolling over their opponents. Among the experienced players are defenders Zephaniah Ngodzo and Zibusiso Sibanda, the midfield quartet of Thembani Masuku, Thabani Goredema, Innocent Kutsanzira and Chris Samakweri. However, Ajax are not intimidated by the “big” names at City, with coach Gugu Hadebe saying they are ready to take the game to the local authority powered club. “It’s a tough game, but one thing for sure is that we are not afraid of them. We’re going as underdogs and are prepared for the encounter. Last weekend we were inactive, but I don’t think that will affect us because we’ve prepared well,” said Hadebe. Ajax’s trump cards are attacking midfielder Tanaka Hove, who scored a hattrick a fortnight ago when they beat Toronto 3-0, goalkeeper Thembelani Ndlovu, captain and defender Clement Veremu as well as striker Butho Phiri. In the event that City beat Ajax this afternoon, table toppers Talen Vision will have a chance to reclaim top spot when they face Indlovu Iyanyathela in a tricky tie at Mzilikazi Barracks tomorrow. Vision head into the clash bubbling with confidence following last weekend’s hard-fought 1-0 win over Bosso 90, while Indlovu Iyanyathela were inactive due to their participation at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair. Perennial campaigners ZPC Hwange travel to Bulawayo to face Bosso 90 at Crescent, with fourth-placed CIWU hosting Binga Pirates at the same venue.
