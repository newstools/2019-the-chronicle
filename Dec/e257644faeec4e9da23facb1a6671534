The Chronicle A model of a human foetus was found by airport staff being sent from Thailand to the US to be used as a voodoo doll. Police were shocked when they were called to check the package and found what appeared to be the body of a dead baby. The package was being flown from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, to an address in Florida and was flagged when it went through security on 22 November. One of the guards recognised the large head and curled up legs as being those of a foetus and alerted paramedics and police. Inside the package they found a 10-inch-long figure made from dark brown resin with a letter that described it as a “ghost ritual voodoo doll”. The model was found at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, when staff noticed an odd shape on an x-ray scan. The recipient, Ronald Leake in Tampa, Florida, has been urged to order a lucky amulet that did not resemble a dead baby. The model was made to be used for “black magic” with the instructions: “If you keep this charm close to you, it will prevent misfortune from happening and keep you away from evil.” Police Major Krit Khunnavech said he understood Leake may be “disappointed” but the type of object he had ordered is prohibited from being sent in the post internationally. It will be returned to the sender, he said. Khunnavech added: “Sending amulets out of the country is allowed but not in the form of a dead baby like this. We have already ordered the post office to send it back to the sender.” — AFP
