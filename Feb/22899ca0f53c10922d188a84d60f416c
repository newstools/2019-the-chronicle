ZIMBABWE heavyweight boxer Elvis Moyo aggravated his left wrist injury in his unanimous 10-round non-title victory against South African Ruan Visser on Sunday. The bout, promoted by 5th Element Promotions and dubbed “Battle of the Warriors”, was Moyo’s first boxing fight in 10-months. Trading leather at a fully packed Sun Arena in Pretoria, South Africa, Moyo was unlucky not to deliver a knockout on the South African. The Bulawayo Bomber said he needs R30 000 to undergo surgery on the wrist. “It was a great fight and to win it by a unanimous decision feels awesome. I think the fans really enjoyed a good fight. I should have won by a knockout, but Visser managed to evade some of my punches that could have blown him away,” said Moyo. “I hurt my hand during the fight. I’ve been carrying this injury for a while and will need R30 000 to do surgery. If the pain eases down, I might take another risk and fight in the Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) Extreme Fighting Championship (EFC) next month,” he said. The pugilist sustained the wrist injury when he successfully defended his World Boxing Federation All-Africa heavyweight title against Kilola Lubika Didier of DR Congo in January 2018. He went on to beat Ukrainian boxer Pedyura Maksym in April still carrying the injury. Despite the injury, Moyo is desperately looking for an opponent to challenge him for the WBF All-Africa heavyweight title. “As you may be aware, I’m at the risk of being stripped of the title if I don’t get a challenger soon. Despite the hand injury, I’ve got lots of gas in me and I’m ready for anyone. I’ve asked my management to ring a couple of stables and find out if we can get an opponent. “Besides defending my title, it’ll also be good if I can manage to get a fight in Europe or anywhere overseas so that I can improve my rankings. I know I have what it takes to face some of the best boxers in the world,” Moyo said. — @ZililoR.
