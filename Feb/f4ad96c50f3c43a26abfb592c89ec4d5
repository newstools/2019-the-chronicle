The Chronicle Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau THE Dynamos executive will not put coach Lloyd Chigowe under immense pressure to deliver silverware in his first full season although they believe he can take the team back to the Champions’ League. Chigowe has been given the room to recruit his players as he embarks on a rebuilding exercise aimed at restoring glory to the Glamour Boys. He retained only five players – Simba Chinani, Kudzi Dhemere, Godfrey Mukambi, Tawanda Macheke and Jimmy Tigere. He has since added more than 13 players, including Edward Sadomba, Munyaradzi Dhiya, Rodwell Mhlanga, Livingstone Genti, Godknows Mangani as well as Ali Joseph Maliselo. The rest of the squad will be unveiled next week. Dynamos spokesperson, Tinashe Farawo, said everything was moving according to expectations. “We are preparing well for the season. As is common knowledge, the 2018 season was not one of the kind we would have wanted to see as Dynamos. “We are Dynamos and we know where we belong. “That is why we have been doing our things quietly, the coach is in the final stages of assembling a new-look outfit which we all believe will challenge for silverware,” said Farawo. He said Chigowe was given the freedom to make his own decisions. “We know what we went through last season when we were almost relegated. But, what we certainly know, is that the coach has done his best,’’ he said. “He has proved to the team what kind of a leader he can be. We are backing what he has built and we believe in his capabilities. “What we are gunning for is certainly silverware which will enable us to play in the Caf competitions. It has been long since we last participated in the African Safari. “That’s our aim this season. Just doing something which will enable us to play in the Caf competitions.”
