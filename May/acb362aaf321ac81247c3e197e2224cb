The Chronicle Kudzai Chikiwa, Chronicle Reporter UNITED States (US) based doctors yesterday started free cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo and commended Government for its reception of foreign health practitioners. Around 20 medical personnel from the US based Operation of Hope Foundation will be conducting the operations until Friday. 50 patients were screened and the doctors expect the number to increase during the course of the week. In an interview, one of the doctors, Dr John Paschen, a paediatrician, said transportation of machinery and medicines has been easier this time around compared to their previous visit last year. “We are very grateful to the Government for making things flexible in the health sector because previously we used to be held at the borders when transporting machinery and drugs but this time it was a different story. We didn’t take much time at the border and our equipment entered without paying any duty,” he said. Dr Paschen said this was a sign that Zimbabwe appreciates services offered by the foundation in its thrust to assist patients who cannot afford the cost of the surgeries. The paediatrician said Mpilo hospital also secured some equipment for them which previously used to be a problem. “We used to face challenges as the hospital did not have enough anaesthesia machines (machines used to deliver oxygen and inhalation anaesthetics to patients) but we are glad that this time Government secured some,” he said. Dr Paschen said Zimbabwe has been appreciative and the media has been spreading the message about their work.—@tamary98
