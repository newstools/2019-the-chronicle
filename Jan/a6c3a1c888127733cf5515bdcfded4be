A 23-YEAR-OLD man from Nkulumane suburb in Bulawayo has been arrested for allegedly looting property worth about $200 from a clinic in the same suburb. Brave Dube together with his co-accused who are still at large broke into Nkulumane clinic and went away with a black LG computer processing unit, black plasma monitor and an LG computer keyboard. Dube appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube facing charges of public violence and theft. He was not asked to plead. The magistrate remanded him in custody to Friday. Prosecuting, Mr Kenneth Shava said on January 15, Dube was part of a mob that was on a looting spree at Bullet shopping centre. They allegedly targeted a clinic located at the shopping centre. “Dube and the mob outnumbered police officers who were trying to restrain the group from causing destruction at the shopping centre. The group managed to get into the clinic and Dube took the above mentioned items and went away,” said Mr Shava. Following a tip off from members of the public, police managed to apprehend Dube and recovered the stolen property at his place of residence, the court heard. The monitor was found in Dube’s bedroom, the keyboard under a shoe rack and the computer processing unit in a stove warmer. The property was taken to the police station and was used as exhibits. — @LissahMangena.
