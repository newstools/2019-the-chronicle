MASVINGO City Council workers have received their 2018 bonus with their salary arrears reduced from three months to one month. Deputy Mayor Councillor Wellington Mahwende said the local authority has managed to pay workers their 13th cheque for last year, a shift from the previous years when council would sometimes forego or stagger the payment of bonus. He said in the past council would pay the bonus over several months due to limited resources. “I think our new council should be commended for paying all employees their bonuses in December despite the economic hardships bedevilling the nation,” said Clr Mahwende. He said the local authority had also managed to reduce employees’ salary arrears despite the limited cashflow. “We have reduced employees’ salary arrears from three months to only one month. We are making frantic efforts towards clearing the one month,” said Clr Mahwende. He said plans were also underway to avail residential stands to council employees as part of their incentives. Clr Mahwende said council was committed to improving the welfare of its employees hence the many measures it is putting in place. “We do not want a repeat of 2011 when employees dragged council to the labour court over a $3,5 million outstanding salary increase. In 2011, employees took the council to the Labour Court over its failure to pay $3,5 million salary increase and they won. When council failed to pay the outstanding money, its property which included more than 100 vehicles, office furniture and equipment and other such property was attached by the Deputy Sheriff. The vehicles included refuse collection trucks, ambulances and Mayor’s official Mercedes Benz, among other vehicles. The council later appealed against the Labour Court ruling and won the case thereby saving its property from being auctioned. — @walterbmswazie2
