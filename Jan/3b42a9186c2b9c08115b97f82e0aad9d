ASPIRING Highlanders vice chairman candidate Longwe Ndlovu has undertaken to donate a beast to the first team when their preseason training gets underway in a week’s time. Longwe, who so far will face the challenge of incumbent Modern Ngwenya in next month’s elections, said he has always been an all-weather friend to the Bulawayo giants when they come knocking on his door and was not donating the beast to seek favours from the members on election day. “Look I have always assisted the club here and there whenever I am asked to. It’s only that this time around there are elections which I am contesting but this is not in any way part of my electioneering. The club came to me like a known member which I am sure it has also done to other members out there and I felt a beast for the boys during their preseason camp will be okay over and above some few litres of drinking water,” said Ndlovu. The businessman and farmer said he will soon launch his campaign trail where he will outline his manifesto. Club chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube confirmed the development and said they approached a number of members and Whatsapp groups for assistance. “We spoke to a number of our members and supporters out there, Ndlovu included, with a view to being assisted during this time of the year as we all know that there is no income coming in since it’s off season. We presented a list of things that we might need during preseason camp and he then promised to provide us with a beast which we appreciate greatly and this gesture will be formally made known to members as we always do when someone assists the club,” said Dube. Highlanders members will next month vote for the vice chairman as well as treasurer, posts held by Ngwenya and Donald Ndebele respectively. No names have been thrown around for the treasurer’s post so far although sources close to Ndebele said he is seeking another mandate.
