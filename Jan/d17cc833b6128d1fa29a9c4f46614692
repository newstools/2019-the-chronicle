FORMER Highlanders and Bantu Rovers development soccer coach, Dumaza Dube has joined MTN Premier League of Eswatini outfit Malanti Chiefs on a six-month contract. The Zimbabwean mentor will serve his stay in the last monarchical nation as assistant to head coach Raymond Dlamini with the immediate assignment being an SMVAF Ingwenyama Cup last 16 tie against Madlenya FC set for the weekend. Malanti Chiefs co-director, Victor Rodriguez confirmed the development yesterday. “We have a new guy joining us from Zimbabwe. He will be assistant to Raymond Dlamini,” said Rodriguez. Efforts to get in touch with Dube on his Zimbabwe number proved futile as his phone was not reachable. Dube is expected to bring wealth of experience to the Piggs Peak-based outfit and will replace Sam Biale, who recently parted ways with the team. He joins a list of foreign coaches that have previously led Malanti Chiefs such as Benjamín Chilongo, Charles Manda, Franco Ndawa, David Solopi and Humprey Mlwane. The former national Under-15 gaffer becomes the fifth Zimbabwean in the Premier League of Eswatini after Julius Chakupewa (Manzini Sundowns), Dolly Zenzile Mpofu and Terisayi Changara (both at Moneni Pirates) and Saúl Chaminuka (Mbabane Highlanders). — @NoelMunzabwa
