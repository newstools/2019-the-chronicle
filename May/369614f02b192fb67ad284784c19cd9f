The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent THE Ministry of Mines and Mining Development is conducting gold mobilisation workshops across the country in a bid to encourage formal mineral deliveries and eliminate illegal deals. The ministry’s director for value addition and beneficiation, Dr Mercy Manyuchi, said the workshops were going to be held in provinces to encourage miners to sell their gold to Fidelity Printers and Refiners, the sole buyer of gold in the country. So far the workshops have been conducted in Mashonaland Central province. “The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development is conducting gold mobilisation workshops across the country in conjunction with various stakeholders from the gold mobilisation task force teams. “These workshops are meant to boost gold deliveries to the legal market by encouraging miners to sell their gold to Fidelity Printers and Refiners, which is the sole buyer of gold in Zimbabwe,” she said. “The gold mobilisations teams were deployed on 28 April and the provinces that are still to be covered are Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Midlands, Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South and Manicaland. “The workshop was successfully conducted in Mashonaland Central. The next province will be Mashonaland West on May 13, followed by Midlands on May 14 and then Matabeleland North Province on May 15. The dates for the remaining provinces are yet to be advised.” Dr Manyuchi said during the workshops miners will be encouraged to abide by the environmental regulations, conduct proper mining practices and keep records. The workshops will also be used to educate miners on mining policies.  -@DubeMatutu
