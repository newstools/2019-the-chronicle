The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent COMEDIAN and celebrity chef Carl Joshua Ncube has been roped in by local food manufacturer Efoods Zimbabwe to come up with a new range of sauce-inspired yoghurts. The company yesterday said they were prompted by Carl’s unorthodox tactics – like his signature Mazoe-basted roasted chicken – to approach him. Efoods head of marketing, Justin Evans, said the new yoghurt range was set to take the breakfast market by storm. The limited edition yoghurts which are in three flavours – tomato, sweet chilli and BBQ will be in store soon. <img class="size-medium wp-image-443177" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carl-Joshua-Ncube-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carl-Joshua-Ncube-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carl-Joshua-Ncube-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carl-Joshua-Ncube-680x529.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Carl-Joshua-Ncube.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Carl Joshua Ncube “This limited edition range is an ideal anytime snack and an alternative addition for cereals, mueslis, smoothies and drinks. Alternatively, the dairy base is a great way to add some flavour to curries, pasta, and even marinades,” Evans said. “The new range combines the full flavoured profiles of ‘traditionally’ cooked meals and re-formulating them for morning meals in a way that combines the best of both worlds. One of our core beliefs is that tasty food should be easy and affordable. “With that in mind, we are always on the look-out for unique ways to bring meals to life through our sauces.” Carl, who last year introduced what he coined the Chef’s Table, said he was always up for any challenge. “I always like to challenge myself to stay creative and find fresh takes on my ingredients. To say no to an exciting opportunity of collaborating with one of my favourite sauces would simply be foolish,” he said.
