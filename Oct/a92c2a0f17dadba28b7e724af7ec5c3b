We want to create a system whereby every district has a chairman, secretary and treasurer. “We want to bring back activities that we used to have such as coaching clinics. “The main agenda is to advance coaches and better their welfare.” “We have invited all area zone and district level coaches so that we complete the process of restructuring. “After we have finished the process of restructuring, we hold elections.” He said as an association they want to make sure that coaches get proper qualifications so that they improve the game. “Football is now a scientific and professional sport, we need our coaches to be conversant with the latest global coaching trends,” said Mukwiti. – @innocentskizoe
