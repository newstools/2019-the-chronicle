Ten people were killed while several others were injured when a Kwekwe-bound kombi collided head on with a bus about 20km outside Gweru along the Gweru-Kwekwe road last night. When the news crew arrived at the scene, some bodies were still strewn on the tarmac. Police at the scene confirmed the death of 10 people and said all of them were from the kombi, which had its roof ripped off following the impact. According to the police officers all the people in the kombi including the driver were killed on the spot while the injured were from the bus owned by Birdgreen Transport Pvt Ltd. The injured were all rushed to Gweru Provincial Hospital. “I boarded this bus from Kadoma but all the way we were complaining of the speed. He then tried to overtake another bus at this curve resulting in the head on collision with the oncoming kombi,” said Mrs Marvelous Marova. Another witness, Mr Kelvin Zimuto also blamed the bus driver for the accident. “The bus driver is to blame for this accident. He was just speeding for nothing and imagine everyone in the kombi was killed,” he said. The Officer Commanding Midlands province Commissioner Moses Magande confirmed the accident and said police were waiting for more details.
