The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter THE National Blood Service Zimbabwe (NBSZ) has assured the nation that the organisation has enough blood supplies following reports that it was facing critical shortages. In a statement, NBSZ spokesperson Mrs Esther Massundah said although the advent of the free blood initiative for all public health institutions in July 2018 had increased demand for blood, NBSZ has managed to meet demand. Mrs Massundah said NBSZ adjusted its collections target upwards and has targeted to collect 108 405 units of blood in 2019. “NBSZ can confirm that Zimbabwe currently has enough stocks for any procedures requiring a transfusion contrary to media reports that we are facing critical shortages. We periodically monitor the blood bank and stocks are maintained at five days’ supply,” she said. “Blood has a shelf life of 42 days, as such NBSZ can’t overstock the blood bank as this will result in expiries”. According to Mrs Massundah, blood users at private health institutions were still paying $120 per pint of blood. “Prior to blood being free, from January 2017 to October 2017 fees were pegged at $100 per pint and from November 2017 to December 2017 fees were reduced to $80. “In January 2018 to June 2018 fees were further reduced to $50 and in July, blood became free for all public health institutions while private health institutions fees were pegged at $120 per unit of blood,” she said. “The NBSZ therefore sincerely apologises to members of the public and health institutions for panic that may have been caused by the misrepresentations in the article and will endeavour to educate the public and media on the blood bank system and its operations”. — @thamamoe.
