The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter EMAKHANDENI Tennis Club is set to host players from across the country in an Africa Day Tennis Open on May 25. According to Emakhandeni Tennis Club chairman Witness Jiyane, they are targeting 100 participants and organisers are now working on finding sponsorship and sorting other logistics. He said the registration process will be officially opened next week. “We’re working on the logistics for one of our high profile annual events. Last year we had 70 participants and this year we hope to have an increased number. “Organisers’ objectives are to see youngsters converging in Bulawayo to showcase their talents. It will also give them a platform to play in a competitive environment,” said Jiyane. Emakhandeni tennis courts have been dormant for more than a decade due to economic challenges and this resulted in fewer youngsters from Bulawayo’s western suburbs taking up the game. A series of events have been held at the courts recently following renovations. — @DecoDecent2
