TOURIST arrivals at the Great Zimbabwe monuments in Masvingo increased by 27,9 percent to 78 000 last year compared to 61 000 recorded in 2017, an official has said. In an interview, the National Museum and Monuments director for Masvingo province Mr Lovemore Mandima said the upsurge in tourist arrivals at the Great Zimbabwe Monuments during the period under review was testimony that tourism was on remound in Masvingo. “In 2018, we had a total of 77 717 visitors to the monuments compared to 61 474 arrivals in 2017. “In January we accounted for 2 870 tourist arrivals of which 405 were foreign tourists. The following month saw foreign tourist arrivals dropped to 270 before picking up by 29 arrivals in March. “In April, the number of foreign tourist arrivals increased to 487,” he said. Mr Mandima said November and December recorded the highest number of tourist arrivals with each month recording more than 15 000 arrivals. He said during last year’s Christmas Holiday, at least 10 000 visitors passed through the world heritage site’s gates. Mr Mandima hailed schools and local visitors for developing an interest in community tourism as they visited the monuments more often than before. He said most of the visitors were schoolchildren. Mr Mandima said during the first quarter between 1 100 and 2 500 tourists visited the monuments. He said the second quarter accounted for 16 433 while the last four months of 2018 recorded 35 823 visitors. “The year 2019 is promising to be better and we expect more tourists into the province. “We have just finished refurbishing Kamungoma war heritage site in Gutu and we are also working on upgrading Gonakudzingwa detention camp at Sango Border Post. — @walterbmswazie2
