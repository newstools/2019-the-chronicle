The Chronicle Chronicle Reporter Zimbabwe celebrates her 39th Independence Day today. It, as always, will be a big moment that came about thanks to the gallant sons and daughters of the soil who sacrificed their lives to fight for the freedom of their motherland from the shackles of British colonialism.  Some died during the liberation war, others survived to see Independence.  But the struggle against colonialism actually started the day when colonialists set foot on Zimbabwe in 1890. They knew that the land was theirs yet there was a group of foreigners from a far-away place and so different from them, who were grabbing their land and livestock, enslaving them, taxing them and setting laws for them. The anger grew and six years later, in 1896 blacks rose against the invading whites in the First Chimurenga/Umvukela.  Despite their commitment to stave off white domination, they were defeated. Many more years of repressive, despotic and racist white rule followed.  Racial segregation against blacks in their own land got more systematic; draconian laws were put in place and any slight moves to challenge the status quo was crushed ruthlessly. Before the 1896 national uprising, the Ndebele people had risen, in 1893 in a regional war but were easily defeated. However, in the late 1950s blacks started mobilising around popular grievances and started forming political parties and transforming their struggles to the more confrontational. The National Democratic Party was formed in the late 1950s.  Needless to say, it was banned but it was followed by Zapu, which later split with Zanu emerging. A few years later the political parties – Zanu and Zapu launched an armed struggle through their military wings, Zanla and Zipra.  Better equipped, more organised and informed and well supported by well-meaning countries such as Mozambique, Zambia, Angola, Libya, Algeria, Tanzania, China, Cuba, Yugoslavia, Russia and Botswana the freedom fighters defeated colonialism.  Independence came on 18 April 1980. The theme for this year is “Zimbabwe at 39, Embracing Devolution for Vision 2030.” The theme is in tune with the programme by the Second Republic to implement devolution of Government authority in terms of the general principles of provincial and local government enshrined in section 265 of the Constitution.  The theme also highlights the importance of devolution of power in the efforts by the Government to attain middle income status by 2030. President Mnangagwa will lead the nation today in marking this very important day on the national calendar while provincial events are lined up across the country.  He officiates at the main event at the National Sports Stadium in Harare. The President gave interviews to our sister paper, The Sunday Mail and ZBCtv at the weekend as part of the build-up to today’s celebration. <img class="size-medium wp-image-445808" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-lights-the-Independence-flame-in-this-file-photo-360x280.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="280" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-lights-the-Independence-flame-in-this-file-photo-360x280.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-lights-the-Independence-flame-in-this-file-photo-768x597.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/President-Emmerson-Mnangagwa-lights-the-Independence-flame-in-this-file-photo-680x529.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> PRESIDENT Mnangagwa’s interview with the national broadcaster, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation TV He implored Zimbabweans to remain united, cherish peace and defend the country’s sovereignty and independence, saying these cardinal principles should not be sacrificed.  He emphasised the need for citizens and political parties to embrace the spirit of dialogue, inclusivity and tolerance to foster nation-building and spur economic development. In his ZBCtv interview to be aired today, he spoke about devolution.  “We have put some money, which is around RTGS$310 million, which translates to a huge sum that is given to each province to deal with priority areas which they themselves as a province, as a locality, as local communities, think are priority in their area; hence, the Government thinks globally over the entire country and says we think this is a priority in Manicaland, this is priority in Mashonaland East, this is a priority in Mat North, but the people in Mat North themselves if given a budget, they have priorities different from those structured or crafted by central Government,” said President Mnangagwa. He called on Zimbabweans to remain united, cherish peace and defend the country’s sovereignty and independence. “Our people, our citizens and proud Zimbabweans of this country: One, let us remain united. Two, let us cherish our peace. Three, let us defend wherever we are, night and day, our sovereignty and our independence – it cannot be sacrificed or sold.  This came to us through sacrifice. Many of our brothers and sisters gave a supreme sacrifice of their lives for us to enjoy this independence and sovereignty we enjoy today. So collectively and individually, let us protect our peace; let us protect our unity; let us protect our country; let us protect our resources (and) let us love each other,” he said. Zanu-PF spokesperson, Cde Simon Khaya Moyo, in a statement on Tuesday stressed the need for all Zimbabweans to celebrate Independence Day. “Since April 1980, Zimbabwe each year celebrates its birthday with national pride and unity of purpose. It’s a day attained through supreme sacrifice by thousands of sons and daughters of this great land after a long and protracted armed liberation struggle against colonialism and settlerism. It was a struggle which took various formations since its inception in the 1890s by our forebearers, meandered through organised boycotts, demonstrations, use of petrol bombs, arson, culminating in the use of arms of war,” said Cde Khaya Moyo adding that thousands of black people were murdered by colonial forces, hundreds maimed, property destroyed and livestock looted during the liberation struggle. “Having nationalist movements like the African National Congress (ANC), National Democratic Party (NDP), Zapu and Zanu successfully banned, the latter two decided to engage in full scale liberation war through their military wings, Zipra and Zanla, initially based in frontline states like Tanzania, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique and Angola. In 1976 the two principal liberation movements (Zapu and Zanu) formed the Patriotic Front as a negotiating forum for talks with the British at Geneva, Malta and Lancaster House talks,” said Cde Khaya Moyo. He said this facilitated the formation of a unity Government by the two parties at independence progressively leading to one party, Zanu-PF under the Unity Accord of December 22, 1987. Cde Khaya Moyo said it is paramount to reflect on the significance of the nation’s birth. “This is a national day and not partisan by any definition. It’s a day for all the people of Zimbabwe to celebrate as one family. It’s historic in all manner.  For the record, this year’s independence celebration is the first after the harmonised elections held on July 30, 2018. The election was resoundingly won by the revolutionary party Zanu-PF. An election considered by local and international observers as the most peaceful, free, fair and credible elections,” he said.
