The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma GWABALANDA’s Natasha Carol Gora was this past weekend crowned Face of Cosmopolitan and will for the coming year serve as the Bulawayo nightspot’s brand ambassador. Outshining 19 other contestants, the 22-year-old model walked away with R1 000 while her first and second princesses Brilliant Brilliant and Thandekile Luphahla walked away with R500 and R250 respectively. Gora, who is studying towards a Diploma in TV and Film Production at the College of Creative Arts in Bulawayo, has ambitions of becoming a full time actress. Speaking on the sidelines of the pageant held at Ascot racecourse, Gora said she hopes the brand ambassadorial post will open doors for her. “It’s such an honour to be crowned queen and given such an opportunity (brand ambassador). I hope this (win) will open more doors for me in the industry,” she said. Gora, who is not new to the world of modelling, was crowned Miss Fingers, Miss Tourism Personality Bulawayo and Miss Gwanda last year. She was also a finalist at last year’s Miss Tourism Zimbabwe contest. As Face of Cosmopolitan, Gora will put her ambassadorial role to practice on April 30 when South Africa’s Prince Kaybee will be in the city for a performance at the nightclub where she will be among his hosts in the club’s VVIP section. – @mthabisi_mthire.
