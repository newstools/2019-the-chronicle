The Chronicle Madrid – Santiago Solari said he would not give up as coach of Real Madrid but the decision will probably not be his to make. Madrid’s season is up in smoke after seven days in which they were eliminated from the Copa del Rey, deemed irrelevant in La Liga and humiliated in the Champions League. “I did not come to the club in such a difficult time to give up,” said Solari, after a 4-1 defeat to Ajax on Tuesday sent his side out in the last 16. In the league and cup, they were proven to be clearly worse than Barcelona, their greatest rivals, and in Europe, inferior to Ajax, the club that are supposed to supply the elite not outplay them in their own back yard. Three defeats, all of them in their own stadium, the last in the competition Madrid had begun to feel was their own after three consecutive triumphs and four in five years. “Here lies a team that made history,” read the front page of Marca on yesterday. “End of an era,” said Diario Sport. “The disaster is huge,” wrote Mundo Deportivo. Solari had overseen a period of progress since taking over from Julen Lopetegui in November but the decline has been quick and familiar. Early improvement gave way to a lack of goals, which slowly sapped belief. Mediocre opponents took advantage and better ones ran riot. The club’s president Florentino Perez must now decide if Solari is worth keeping until the summer, although it is hard to see what would be gained by sacking him when there is nothing left to be gained from the season. A new coach, with the same squad, would only surrender the feeling of freshness while for Perez, there might also be merit in waiting until June when more candidates could become available.
