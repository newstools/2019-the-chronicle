The Chronicle Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter CHOPPIES Supermarket in Bulawayo allegedly lost more than $3 000 after a till operator ran a scam to steal cash. Sibusisiwe Sibanda (24) yesterday appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya who remanded her out of custody on free bail to tomorrow for provision of a trial date. She pleaded not guilty to fraud or alternatively, a theft charge. Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said Sibanda defrauded a Choppies outlet represented by branch manager, Mr Dumiso Nyoni (46). “Sibanda would make customers pay the exact amount for goods being bought but enter less on the Supermarket’s system. A receipt would still be produced as Sibanda would add an accept option,” said Mr Dlodlo. The court heard how Sibanda was manipulating the system to her advantage purporting that the transactions were genuine by misrepresenting the amount charged for the product and also inputting false reference numbers. “On January 7 this year, an accountant at Choppies Zimbabwe carried out a routine check on mobile money transfers for the Supermarket. “The accountant observed that the figures retrieved from the mobile service provider did not tally with the amounts that were on the company bank deposit slips,” said the prosecutor. The EcoCash statements and deposit slips revealed that there were notable variances in the amounts, the court heard. The total prejudice is $3 041 and nothing was recovered. —@gwizi_n
