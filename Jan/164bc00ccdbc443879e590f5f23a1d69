A 23-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly stealing goods worth $3 350 from two cars that were parked in the city’s Central Business District (CBD). Sikhanyiso Ndlovu yesterday appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mrs Adelaide Mbeure who remanded him in custody to February 14 for commencement of trial. He pleaded not guilty to the theft charges. Allegations are that on January 8, Ms Nyengeterai Svusvu parked her Toyota Corolla car opposite Bulawayo Centre, at the corner of Fort Street and 9th Avenue. She closed all the windows and locked all the doors. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said Ndlovu allegedly approached the parked car and broke a window and opened the passenger door and stole a brown bag. The court heard that the handbag had two cell phones, an Iphone 8 plus, Iphone 6 and a red PPC overall as well as body lotion all valued at $3 200. “Ms Svusvu came back and discovered the offence and proceeded to ZRP Bulawayo Central to make a report,” said Mr Mageza. The court heard that on the next day, Ndlovu went on to steal from a Mercedes Benz ML 320 which was parked along Fife Street. “While Mr Tshakalisa Moyo went into Choppies supermarket for shopping, Ndlovu approached the car, snatched a brown bag with two trousers, one short, two t-shirts, body lotion, tooth brush and perfume,” said the prosecutor. The stolen property was valued at $150. Mr Moyo caught Ndlovu in the act and shouted for help and members of the public apprehended him. Ndlovu was handed over to the police. Ndlovu stole property worth $3 350 and property worth $200 was not recovered. — @gwizi_n
