A NEW Bulawayo TV series, Hotel Khumalo, will be shown to the public from March 30 to April 1 at the Ster-Kinekor cinemas. Hotel Khumalo is a fast-paced, unpredictable TV series which explores various themes such as corruption, crime, marriage, infidelity and teenage pregnancy among many other societal issues. Written and directed by Scrah Mudala, the production has a talented cast which includes veteran actress Precious Makhulumo from Amakorokoza, actor/model Calvin Madula and TV personality Nyasha Mutamangira. Also involved in the production of the TV series are graduates from the Midlands State University, Wits University, University of Cape Town as well as interns from local colleges and universities. Producer of the TV series, Ali Muchato, said the series was meant to premiere in December last year but those plans had to be shelved due to financial constraints. Muchato said after the Bulawayo premiere, they would take the production to other cities and towns. “We’re going to do screenings all around Zimbabwe including Harare, Gweru and Victoria Falls. We’re also planning to take the production to South Africa. We also have a number of broadcasters who are interested in the product whom we’re still negotiating with for the series to be shown on TV.”
