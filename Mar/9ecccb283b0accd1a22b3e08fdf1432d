DAUGHTER of the late legendary jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi, Selmor, brought nostalgic moments when she performed some of her father’s greatest hits at the Vintage Bar Shisha in Bulawayo on Saturday. Selmor, who was backed by her mother Melody Murape, older sister Sandra and husband Tendai Manatse, provided a great intimate acoustic show. She kicked off her performance with a cover version of Oliver’s song Seiko and emotionally sang Neria. Fans could not help but sing along, making the event very memorable. Not only did she sing her father’s songs but performed hits like Nguva Yangu and recent release, Vakanaka Vakarara. She also took time to teach her Bulawayo fans the Chiro dance as a way to cheer them up after having started the event on a mellow note. Speaking after her great performance, Selmor said she was grateful for the opportunity to perform in Bulawayo and thanked people for supporting her. “I’m pleased that many people came through to the show. We’ll definitely be returning with the whole Tuku band,” she said. Selmor, who is on a mission to keep her late father’s performing spirit alive, revealed plans to release an album this year. On the alleged feud with Daisy Mtukudzi, Selmor declined to comment saying she would rather discuss her music only. Sandra, asked if she would pursue a solo music career in future, said: “Absolutely, it’s something on the cards and I might drop something this year. For now though, we’re just focused on continuing the legacy of our father as a family.”
