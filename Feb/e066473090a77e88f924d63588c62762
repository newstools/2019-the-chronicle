FORMER Highlanders and Bulawayo City defensive midfielder, Douglas Sibanda, has joined Zifa Southern Region Division One League side Talen Vision. Sibanda (28) has been brought along with former Bantu Rovers and Bulawayo Chiefs’ left-back Mthulisi Sibanda, attacking midfielder Mkhululi Bhebhe and striker Adrian Banana. Bhebhe spent last season on loan at Tsholotsho from Chicken Inn, while Banana warmed the bench at Chicken Inn. Mkhuphali Masuku, the Talen Vision coach who guided the club to a third place finish last season, confirmed the capture of the quartet. The ex-Highlanders, Caps United and Harare City coach is hoping the four will add value to his side, which aims to improve on their last season’s performance. “We are continuing with almost the same players we had last season, filling gaps left by some players that moved to other teams. This is our third week of training and the new guys seem to be adapting well to the team setup. Ours are not major signings, but players that we feel will give us the depth we need to last the race. What we want is to do better than last season,” said Masuku. In 2018, Talen Vision ended in position three behind Hwange, who were promoted to the Premiership, and Tsholotsho. Talen Vision should brace for a stiff 2019 campaign, with Bulawayo City, who were relegated from the topflight, being pre-season title favourites. Perennial campaigners ZPC Hwange, Tsholotsho and Makomo are some of the teams expected to give Talen Vision a good run for their money. Talen Vision lost utility players Mbekezeli Sibanda to Highlanders, winger Osie Miniru-Sunday, who joined Ngezi Platinum Stars, and defender Felix Moyo, who was snapped up by Bulawayo Chiefs. They also released goalkeeper Emanuel Dari and midfielder Mandla Mkhwananzi to Filabusi United. – @ZililoR.
