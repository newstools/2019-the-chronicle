The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A 38-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo’s Emthunzini suburb has been arrested for allegedly possessing 330 grammes of dagga. Nkosilathi Nkomo was last Monday searched by detectives following his arrest for unlawful entry and theft and was found in possession of 330 grammes of dagga which has a street value of $200. Nkomo appeared before West Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube who remanded him in custody to Friday last week for commencement of trial. However, Nkomo failed to appear in court on Friday due to unknown reasons. Prosecuting, Mr Tapiwa Solani told the court that on Monday last week at around 8AM, detectives searched Nkomo’s home and found dangerous drugs in his bedroom. He said the detectives raided Nkomo’s residence and searched his room where they discovered a plastic bag containing dagga on his bed leading to his arrest. Recently, a 32-year-old man from Bulawayo was sentenced to three months in prison for possessing 470 grammes of dagga with an estimated street value of $470. Munyaradzi Chinemhere of Njube suburb was stopped and searched at a street corner by police officers from Njube Police Station and was found in possession of the dagga. Chinemhere pleaded guilty to contravening a section of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act which criminalises dealing in dangerous drugs. When asked by Western Commonage magistrate, Mr Lungile Ncube, why he was in possession of the dagga, Chinemhere said he wanted to smoke it. “My friend from the rural areas sent me the dagga and I only wanted to smoke it,” he said. – @sharonbuwe
