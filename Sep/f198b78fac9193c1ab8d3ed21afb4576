The Chronicle Sixteen-year-old Barcelona star Ansu Fati received high praise from the Spanish media after becoming the club’s youngest ever goalscorer in Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Osasuna. The forward also became the third youngest scorer in La Liga history when he netted Barca’s first goal on 51 minutes, just six minutes after coming off the bench as a half-time substitute. Fati scored the equaliser for the Spanish champions after Roberto Torres’ first-half opener, and Barca took the lead on 64 minutes through Arthur Melo. However, Ernesto Valverde’s men were unable to secure all three points, with Torres scoring his second from the penalty spot after Gerard Pique handled in the area. Wonderkid Fati stole the headlines in Spain yesterday morning, with AS celebrating the youngster’s contribution after he helped Barcelona to ‘avoid another fiasco’. Barca have made a slow start in their attempt to retain the league title, earning just five points from a possible nine after opening day defeat by Athletic Bilbao, victory over Real Betis and a draw at El Sadar Stadium. The headline of SPORT newspaper read: ‘Ansu and little else’, further highlighting Barcelona’s disjointed start to the season. The media outlet also reported that the La Masia academy graduate ‘took Barcelona out of mediocrity’ with his very first touch. Barca face Valencia next at the Nou Camp on September 14 as they look to kickstart their 2019-20 campaign.— mailonline
