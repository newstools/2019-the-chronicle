The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter Amagugu International Heritage Centre  in Matobo district is hosting its annual week-long Traditional Food and Beverage Expo from today. Now in its third edition, the expo is held in a bid to raise citizen awareness on the inherent nutritional value of traditional food and beverages. At the event, 60km along Bulawayo-Kezi/Maphisa Road, people are taught new recipes and sample a diverse range of traditional food and beverages. The first five days of the expo have been dedicated to primary and secondary schools through an educative culinary experience that has been arranged for them. Event organiser Butholezwe Nyathi said the school pupils will be taught how to prepare various African dishes. “We’ll share with the young ones, various African dishes – how they are prepared and the attendant nutritional value,” he said. On Saturday, the expo will be open to the general public with various traditional foods and beverages set to be exhibited. The center has also roped in corporates who will exhibit their products on the day. Hwabaraty, Drums of Peace and Charles Banda are expected to perform with various activities such as mountain climbing, mountain top music experience, cooking competitions and braai on the rocks being lined up. “We’re excited that the third edition of the Traditional Food and Beverage Expo is finally here. It’s going to be a great week of celebrating our traditional food and beverages,” said Nyathi. “For this year’s edition, we’ll conduct workshops where we’ll discuss the effects of climate change and how it vastly affects food security. We’ll also urge small scale farmers to grow traditional foods as they have high nutritional value and are drought resistant.”
