The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter INDUNA Barracks will next week play host to the annual Zimbabwe National Army schools sports competitions and merit awards where 18 army schools will compete in nine sporting disciplines, quiz and music. According to Headquarters 1 Infantry Brigade public relations officer Captain Brian Muchero, the games will run from Monday to Friday where the ZNA Commander, Lieutenant General Edzayi Chimonyo will be the guest of honour for the closing ceremony. Lt Gen Chimonyo will be expected to hand out medals and prizes to the winning athletes and schools. “Chief of Staff Administrative Staff Major General Paul Chima will be the guest of honour at the official opening ceremony on Monday,” said Muchero. Sporting disciplines that will be competed for are soccer (boys and girls), netball, volleyball, athletics, basketball, rugby, cricket, chess and darts. “All the ZNA schools congregate annually to compete in various sporting disciplines and the academic side. The whole idea is to promote the spirit of excellence in both curriculum and co curriculum activities. It’s our objective that ZNA schools should be a model of all schools in Zimbabwe,” said Administrative Staff Officer Grade 2 army education Corp Major Wise Gatsi. Last year, the competitions were hosted by HQ 5 Infantry Brigade in Kwekwe.
