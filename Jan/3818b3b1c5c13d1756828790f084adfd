AN illegal money changer from Emganwini suburb in Bulawayo lost more than US$4 000 to seven gun-totting robbers who raided his home while he was sleeping early yesterday morning. The suspects, who were armed with pistols, assaulted Mr Kudakwashe Masunda (28) before demanding cash at around 1AM. One of the suspects allegedly pointed a gun at him demanding cash. They took away US$4 000 and three Samsung cell phones worth US$260 before fleeing from the scene. Bulawayo provincial deputy police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said they were investigating the case. He said the suspects jumped over a precast wall into Mr Masunda’s yard and forced open the doors. “They proceeded to his bedroom where they attacked him while he was sleeping as they demanded money,” said Insp Ncube. He warned illegal money changers that they are increasingly being targeted by criminals because of the way they flash around hoards of cash. “It’s not surprising that most illegal money changers have become targets as they are the only people known to be having money. We warn them to desist from their trade as not only do they break the law but also risk their lives. “However, this does not mean we are justifying criminal activities. We are investigating the case and we want to issue a stern warning to robbers that their days are numbered,” Insp Ncube said. He appealed to people who might have information on the whereabouts of the suspects to come forward. Last month, three unknown armed robbers attacked a woman from Nkulumane suburb and got away with $3 000 and R8 000. The three suspects pounced on Ms Ruth Mpambela, a suspected illegal money changer, at her Nkulumane 12 suburban home at about 6PM as her children were trying to open the gate for her. They attacked her on the head with a sharp object before stealing cash and her vehicle’s registration book. — @winnie_masara.
