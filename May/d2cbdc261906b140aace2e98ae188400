The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter A new modelling reality TV show named Strut n Pose is set to premiere on ZBCtv soon. Produced by renowned music video director Andy Cutta and fashion designer Maita Marimo, the show that will be hosted by Gilmore Tee, is dedicated to fashion and modelling enthusiasts. Cutta said the idea of the reality show came after the realisation that there was a lack of training facilities for Zimbabwean models. “I work very closely with models on music videos, advertisements and fashion shoots and I realised that more often, our local models lack the right characteristics and professionalism in their craft. This inspired me to come up with this show in order to assist them,” he said. The reality show, which they started shooting last year, is almost complete. It will feature 15 models who will tackle various challenges in every episode in a bid to impress a panel of three judges and a guest judge. From there, they will need to survive elimination. “In each and every episode, models will be tasked to do a challenge which might be fashion related or about launching a product. Every week, a model will be eliminated. “We’re not looking for the usual runway models but models who standout,” said Andy Cutta. He said they were recording the reality show in different parts of the country. “Every model who wins a task in each episode gets a small prize and will be immune from elimination. We hope that all the 15 models who will appear in the show, whether they would have won or not will have improved and learnt a lot of things from the show.” The producer said they are yet to finalise the premiere dates of the reality show as they are still to reach an agreement with ZBCtv.
