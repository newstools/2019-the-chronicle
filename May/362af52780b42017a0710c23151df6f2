The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter In order to engage and encourage people to visit the National Art Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo, a new concept called the Friday Late at the Gallery has been introduced. This event where exhibitions will be showcased, entertainment provided and food served, will take place once a month at the Bulawayo Art Gallery. Explaining the new concept, National Art Gallery of Zimbabwe in Bulawayo curator Clifford Zulu said: “This is a new project that we’re developing to try and attract more people from the city to visit the gallery frequently and enjoy some of the services that we offer.” The first event took place last Friday with the exhibition of ‘Facing Bulawayo’, a collaborative effort initiated in February by London artist Philip Butler as well as the art gallery with the support of Alliance Française of Bulawayo. Together, they resuscitated the Life Drawing classes that have been happening for the past weeks. The event saw visitors have an opportunity to interact with the artists through the open studios. There were also live music performances as well as food and drink stalls.
