The Chronicle Cape Town — Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo opted to skip the ceremony in Paris to attend the Serie A awards. Following a successful first season in Italy, the 34-year-old received an award for the Best Forward for the 2018/19 season while also snatching the Most Valuable Player in Serie A. “I’m proud to be the best player in Serie A,” he said when accepting the award. “I thank my teammates and everyone who voted for me. Now I’ll work to be here again next year.” Ronaldo netted 26 goals in his debut Serie A season and helped Juventus towards another domestic crown. The Portugal captain ended fourth overall in Serie A scoring charts as he rattled the back of the net 21 times in 31 appearances. The former Real Madrid star was also named in the Serie A Team of the Year alongside team-mates Joao Cancelo (ex-Juventus now Manchester City), Giorgio Chiellini and Miralem Pjanic. — Sport24.
