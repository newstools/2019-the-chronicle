A GERMAN athletics expert will this week hold a sprints and hurdles coaching seminar for coaches at White City and National Sports Stadium respectively. The course is meant to capacitate the coaches with the latest trends and requirements of the sport and comes at a time before the 2019 athletics season goes into full gear. “The National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe is happy to announce that on January 18, we will be running a seminar at White City Stadium facilitated by a German international expert for sprints and hurdles. We are inviting all coaches from Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, parts of Midlands, Masvingo and of course Bulawayo to come and interact and share ideas especially the technical aspects of the sport,” said Naaz president Tendai Tagara. He urged coaches from private and public schools, colleges and clubs to seize the rare opportunity and attend the seminary. “I am therefore calling all athletics coaches from private and public schools, colleges, clubs as well as tertiary institutions to come and meet with the best in the game. The German expert will present a paper on coaching hurdles and sprints and then after that we will have an open session for question and answer about such events like 100m, 200m and 400m among other shot races so coaches and teachers this is an opportunity. After Bulawayo we will then move to Harare the falling day for the same course. Sprints is a very exciting area in athletics so I urge those interested to please attend,” said Tagara. The Zimbabwe athletics season kicked off last week with a competition in Harare which was also the first stage for selecting a squad for the upcoming African Junior Championship set for Cote D’ Ivoire in April this year.
