ZIMBABWE is expected to experience near record-high temperatures across the country from today up to Saturday, the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) warned yesterday. The MSD said in a statement that a series of high temperatures will hit the country’s low-lying areas today and the areas are likely to record extreme temperatures of between 30 and 36 degrees Celsius. “The Meteorological Services Department wishes to advise the public in the following areas: Matabeleland South, Masvingo, much of Midlands, Manicaland and most of Mashonaland provinces that high daytime temperatures will affect these areas today,” read part of the statement. The department urged people to take precautionary measures such as drinking lots of water and avoiding prolonged stay in the sun. “Due to the hot conditions, the general public is advised to stay hydrated by taking a lot of fluids and those engaging in outdoor activities are advised to put on sun hats,” said the MSD. “Direct exposure to solar radiation should be kept at a minimum, especially during the hottest part of the day, which is between 11am and 3pm. “These temperatures are expected to range from 30 to 36 degrees Celsius and are linked to hot and dry winds blowing from warmer regions near the Equator.”
