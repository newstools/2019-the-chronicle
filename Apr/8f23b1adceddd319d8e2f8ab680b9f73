The Chronicle Mashudu Netsianda, Senior Court Reporter A 71-YEAR-OLD widow from Jotsholo in Kusile District, Matabeleland North province allegedly sexually abused a nine-year-old boy who was left under her custody. This emerged when Musa Ndlovu of Sobendile village approached the Bulawayo High Court seeking bail pending trial, citing the State as respondent. Ndlovu allegedly invited the boy to her bedroom hut and ordered him to undress before she allegedly demanded that he inserts his genital into hers. Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Nokuthula Moyo granted Ndlovu bail of $50 and ordered her to reside at her given address in Lupane until the matter is finalised as part of the bail conditions. Ndlovu is facing a charge of aggravated indecent assault and she will next appear at Lupane magistrates’ court on April 5. The State, which was represented by Mr Trust Muduma, did not oppose Ndlovu’s bail application, saying the interests of justice would not be compromised if she is granted bail. Ndlovu, who was a self actor, said she would not abscond if granted bail given her old age. She is also denying the charge, arguing that she was framed. Ndlovu offered to pay $50 bail and adhere to the stipulated bail conditions. According to State papers, it is alleged that during the month of November last year, Ndlovu called the complainant to her bedroom hut. When the boy walked into the room he found Ndlovu naked. The accused person ordered the boy to remove his clothes and went on to caress his private parts before allegedly ordering him to have sex with her. The boy informed his parents who in turn made a report to the police leading to Ndlovu’s arrest. The complainant was taken to the hospital where a medical examination was conducted.—@mashnets
