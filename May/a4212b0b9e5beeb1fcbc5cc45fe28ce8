The Chronicle Responses to “Khupe lays stake on MDC-T”. Harvest House and other MDC-T assets that Chamisa is holding on to are the issue. This includes the $1.8m political parties’ fund that Chamisa received towards the end of the last Parliament. — Muzezuru. Chamisa should give Khupe her rightful place. This is the same young man who has gone around the world questioning ED’s legitimacy. At least ED’s presidency was upheld by the Constitutional Court. Here are his two choices: 1) Resort to being a card carrying member; 2) Move out of Harvest House and form his own party. How the mighty have fallen. — Gonzondishefu. Response to “Millers, retailers in pact to tame price madness”. We are a lazy lot in this country. Firstly, people including urbanites, should never worry about the price of mealie meal in shops. They shouldn’t even go into shops for this commodity. We have maize that is sold all over and grinding mills at just about every corner. If people shun the shops and go for the mill-run mealie meal (it’s healthier too) those selling the commodity will be forced to reduce their prices. The same goes for veggies, bread, buns, rolls, beans etc. The problem with us is we do not want to change. In fact, we are stupid to put it mildly. Why should one believe a burger or some fancy chicken is better than home cooked food? We are too extravagant, no wonder businesses are exploiting us. I was in town last weekend and despite the so-called exorbitant prices, one retail supermarket was packed with people pushing trolleys full of polonies, cereal, exotic types of bread, cat and dog food, snacks, toys, wines and whiskies, you name it. One wonders what it is that people are really moaning about. — Masaisa.
