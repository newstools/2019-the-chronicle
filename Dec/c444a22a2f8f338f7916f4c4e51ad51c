The Uefa boss who is also Fifa vice president is being hosted by Cosafa president Phillip Chiyangwa. He will end his visit to the country with a meeting with Government officials in Harare on January 6. “The Uefa president will be hosted by Government on the 6th before he departs. We are leaving Victoria Falls for Harare to start preparing for the function while he continues with his itinerary as he is supposed to visit Binga and Hwange,” said Chiyangwa yesterday The Slovenian lawyer-cum-businessman and wife Barbara arrived in the country on Friday with a delegation of 20 people comprising mostly family members including his three daughters Nina (26), Neza (17) and Ana (14). They sampled a number of activities in Victoria Falls before leaving for Hwange yesterday where they are expected to visit the Hwange National Park and Binga. The two football leaders have been having private discussions on possible areas of cooperation in football although both haven’t opened up on what was discussed. Ceferin has said he is keen to explore areas of cooperation towards development of sports tourism, saying Victoria Falls has potential to attract international clubs for off season training and friendlies. While in Victoria Falls Ceferin visited the Rainforest and also did activities such as bungee jumping, helicopter flight and jet boat. He said he was excited to have seen the Falls. “We had been told that its dry but we have seen that it’s not. In fact, its water everywhere, its flowing,” he said. This is despite recent reports by BBC’s Stephen Sackur that the Falls are dry. Ceferin has been to Namibia, Botswana, Tunisia and Tanzania among other African countries. From Hwange and Binga Ceferin and his delegation will proceed to Matopos National Park, Great Zimbabwe and Vumba Mountains. Ceferin took over as the Uefa boss in September 2016. He was voted sports personality of the year in the same year by Slovenian sports newspaper Ekipa SN, in a poll of newspaper journalists and readers. In January 2019, SportsPro Media included Ceferin in the list of the most influential people in the sports industry. The UEFA president was also selected as one of the people of 2018 by the influential World Soccer magazine. — @ncubeleon
