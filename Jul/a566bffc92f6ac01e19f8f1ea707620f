The Chronicle Cape Town — Liverpool star Sadio Mane has been urged by the head of the Senegalese football association Saee Seck to join Real Madrid for the good of his career. Seck believes his fellow countryman would take the next step in his career by joining Los Blancos. Real have been heavily linked but Liverpool have no intention of cashing in on the forward. That would be a shame according to Seck, who wants to see Mane in Madrid. Seck said: “Everybody in the world knows that Mane is in the top 10 best footballers in the world and he has achieved significant success at Liverpool in the past season. “He alongside Mo Salah and Firmino are phenomenal. “But this is football and he won the Champions League last season and he has the chance to go to Madrid. “For me I think it’s the best club in the world, even if I am a Barcelona fan I still think Real is the best and Mane should be thinking of that offer seriously. “The career of a footballer is very short and sometimes you don’t get the chance a lot so if it’s there, and I think Zidane likes him, why not?” — Sport24
