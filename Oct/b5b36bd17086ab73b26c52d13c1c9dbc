The Chronicle Kudzai Chikiwa, Chronicle Reporter THE National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) has increased intra-city commuter train fares to $2 for a return ticket with effect from tomorrow. Last month NRZ increased inter-city passenger train fares by 100 percent but intra-city fares had remained at $1 for a return ticket. NRZ Public Relations Manager, Mr Nyasha Maravanyika, yesterday said the adjustment had been necessitated by rising operational expenses. “Our commuter train that plies Cowdray Park to the city will be increasing its fare to $2 return ticket. This has been necessitated by rising operational costs,” he said. Mr Maravanyika said NRZ has not been spared by economic challenges hence the fare hikes are meant to strike a balance. “Although we have a duty to provide affordable transport services to the people, we need to balance the cost of operations and service provision. That is why we have moved on to increase so that we survive the economic pressures,” said Mr Maravanyika. Mr Maravanyika said due to fare hikes by road transporters, the parastatal is getting pressure from commuters who are demanding more trains for the intra-city routes. Kombis now cost $4 per trip while Zupco buses now charge $2 per return trip. “We have been overwhelmed and oversubscribed with commuters. There are even calls for more commuter trains in Bulawayo and Harare,” he said. Mr Maravanyika said the commuter train though it has increased fares, still remains affordable given that Zupco recently hiked fares. — @tamary98
