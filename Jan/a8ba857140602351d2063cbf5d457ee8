POLICE have set up a temporary base at a school in Figtree after a suspected serial robber unleashed a reign of terror on pupils and teachers. The suspected fugitive, Braveman Mukoni (21) of Stand Number 1, Mgadla village, is facing charges of threats of violence and malicious damage to property. Mukoni also has a pending case at the Regional Court in Bulawayo where he was remanded out of custody. Teachers who spoke to The Chronicle on condition of anonymity said they feared for their lives and safety as the alleged fugitive has made multiple threats against some teachers. “We left the annex and moved to the main school as the new school is a bit isolated. We thank police for responding to our SOS call. However, we will only feel safe when he is arrested,” said one teacher. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele said police had set up a temporary base in the area to safeguard pupils and teachers. “Police are looking for information that could lead to the arrest of a 21-year-old man facing assault and threats of violence charges. He has threatened some teachers at Mgadla and Samathonga Primary schools and has been on the run ever since reports were filed against him. “To guarantee the safety of teachers and pupils at Samathonga primary and its Annex, Mgadla primary school, we have set up a temporary base in the area to ensure that the community is protected from the fugitive. We call upon members of the public to come forward with any information that will lead to the arrest of the suspect,” said Chief Insp Ndebele. Mgadla villagers who spoke to this newspaper said they were living in fear of the man who seems to be evading arrest. — @andile_tshuma.
