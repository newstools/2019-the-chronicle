The Chronicle Pamela Shumba, Senior Reporter THE Environmental Management Agency (EMA) has reported Bulawayo City Council to the police for allegedly discharging raw sewer into rivers and the environment. According to the latest council minutes, the city council said it had been contacted by four different police stations in connection with the flouting of environmental laws. “The Town Clerk reported on July 3, 2019 that council had been served with quite a number of orders from EMA for discharge of raw sewer into rivers and the environment. “It has since turned out that EMA has escalated the matter and reported council to the police for prosecution,” reads the council minutes. The council indicated that it had been contacted by four police stations so far who were working on four different dockets. “Authority has since been sought for director of engineering services, Engineer Simela Dube to appear on behalf of the city council and answer any allegations relating to sewerage disposal issues,” said BCC. The city council has over the years been threatened with prosecution by EMA over environmental offences. The offences included discharging raw sewage into water bodies, with most of the effluent finding its way into Umguza River, while some of it is a potential breeding ground for diseases within the city. The agency has also fined the city council, other local authorities and industrial companies thousands of dollars for polluting water bodies and the environment, putting the lives of the public at risk. Ema has indicated that local authorities like the Bulawayo City Council that had been warned a number of times risked being taken to court or appearing before the EMA board for stiffer sentences. Other local authorities such as the City of Harare, Chitungwiza and Norton have in the past appeared before the EMA board after repeatedly flouting environmental laws.—@pamelashumba1
