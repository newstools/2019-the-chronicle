Her mother together with her two brothers left her and went to Ngulube’s house,” said Mr Mageza. “Ngulube ran towards his mother-in-law and kicked her three times on the legs. When the brothers who were walking behind realised that their mother had fallen to the ground they chased Ngulube but he outpaced them”.—@gwizi_n.
