ONE person died while 13 others were injured when a commuter omnibus they were travelling in overturned along Plumtree Road in Bulawayo’s Belmont Industrial Area. The accident happened at around 9:30PM on Thursday when the kombi was coming from Southwold suburb direction and headed towards the city centre. Bulawayo Chief Fire and Ambulance Officer Mr Richard Peterson said the driver lost control of the vehicle and it veered off the road and overturned. “We received an SOS call at around 9:50PM on Thursday 7 February 2019. Our ambulances ferried eight people to hospitals with varied degrees of injuries while three other people were rushed to hospital by Centurion and Emras ambulances which were also called to the scene,” he said. “One injured person, perhaps due to panic and confusion, got off the vehicle and ran aimlessly before collapsing and dying within the vicinity of the accident scene. All the passengers that we ferried to hospital were males between the ages of 17 ad 21. It is unfortunate that we continue to lose lives like this. Motorists should safely transport commuters.” The name of the deceased has been withheld as their next of kin are yet to be advised. “The rainy season is upon us and we urge motorists to exercise extreme caution when driving on wet roads as they tend to be slippery because of the rains,” said Mr Peterson.
