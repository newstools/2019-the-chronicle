The Chronicle Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau LADY Chevrons coach Adam Chifo says playing the International Cricket Council Women’s T20 Africa Regional qualifiers in Zimbabwe gives his charges an edge. He wants to lead them to a maiden T20 World Cup in Australia next year. The Africa Regional qualifier will be played at Old Hararians, Takashinga Sports Club and Harare Sports Club from May 5-13. Two top teams will progress to the Global Qualifier. With Uganda, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Nigeria and Mozambique also taking part, Chifo believes his team just needs to improve in some aspects to emerge victorious. “Obviously, it’s a privilege for us to be hosting the regional qualifiers. We are looking forward to a very good performance. “I know there is a lot of pressure after we failed the last time we went there. “But, with time still on our side, I think we can prepare enough so that we are ready when the tournament starts,” said Chifo. The Lady Chevrons thrashed Namibia 5-0 in a bi-lateral series last month. “Currently, we have a batting camp underway where we are addressing certain aspects of T20 batting,’’ said Chifo. “In two weeks’ time, we will also have a bowling camp for a week and we will be going through the skills needed in T20. “So, technically, we are having camps for that and, hopefully, things will be fine before the tournament.” He said no one was guaranteed a place in the team. Only all-rounder Chiedza Muzembi plays her cricket outside the country in South Africa with the rest based locally.
