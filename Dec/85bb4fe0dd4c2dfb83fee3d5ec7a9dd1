The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A 75-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has been arrested for allegedly axing his neighbour after an unknown misunderstanding. It is alleged that Stewart Sdubi from Emganwini suburb struck Mr Simon Moyo (65) with an axe on his left ear after delivering a letter at his home. It was not mentioned in court what was written in the letter. Mr Moyo went to the United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) for treatment. Sdubi pleaded not guilty to assault before Western Commonage magistrate Ms Tancy Dube. He was remanded out of custody on free bail to today for continuation of trial. Prosecuting, Mr Tapiwa Solani said on November 20 this year, Sdubi allegedly went to Mr Moyo’s place holding an axe and a letter. “The accused person gave the complainant a letter to read. As he was reading, the accused person unlawfully committed an assault upon the complainant with an axe intending to cause bodily harm,” he said. Mr Moyo said he was suspicious when Sdubi came to his home in the evening holding a letter and an axe. “The accused person came at night and knocked at my gate saying there was a letter that I needed to read. I went outside and while I was reading, the accused person assaulted me with an axe and he ran away,” he said. The matter was reported to the police leading to Sdubi’s arrest.-@sharonbuwe
