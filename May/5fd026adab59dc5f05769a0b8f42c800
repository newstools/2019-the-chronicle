The Chronicle Cape Town — The news out of the Proteas camp yesterday centred around Anrich Nortje’s withdrawal from the World Cup squad. More concerning, however, is the reality that Kagiso Rabada and Dale Steyn have not yet been given the all-clear. Nortje picked up a freakish hand injury in Port Elizabeth on Monday and will be replaced in the squad by Chris Morris, but attention will now turn swiftly to Rabada and Steyn and getting the duo fit and firing for the May 30 tournament opener against England at The Oval. Team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee and physiotherapist Craig Govender addressed media in Johannesburg yesterday, and it quickly became clear that both Steyn and Rabada faced significant fitness challenges between now and the World Cup. Rabada’s current state is more worrying than Steyn’s. “Kagiso Rabada developed a significant lower back lumbar muscle strain with associated muscle spasms while playing for Delhi,” Moosajee explained. “The anticipated recovery period is two to three weeks and we are hopeful that he will make a recovery to be part of the World Cup squad.” The use of the word “hopeful” does not inspire much confidence. Rabada’s role in this Proteas World Cup charge can never be understated. He is undoubtedly South Africa’s biggest strength with the ball, and he is the man tasked with leading a fast bowling attack that most accept is Faf du Plessis’ most dangerous weapon heading into the tournament. While Nortje’s withdrawal is obviously unfortunate, a Rabada withdrawal would be catastrophic for the Proteas. —Sport24.
