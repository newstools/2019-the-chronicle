THE Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Kirsty Coventry has reacted angrily to the shocking, embarrassing and close to sabotage action that led to the barring of the Warriors from training at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. The national team is preparing for a do or die African Nations Cup qualifier against Republic of Congo tomorrow where victory or draw will see Zimbabwe book a ticket to the finals in Egypt. Minister Coventry took to her official macro blogging site Twitter to express her disgust at the unfortunate incident. “I will get to the bottom of this,” said Minister Coventry describing the behaviour by those responsible as ‘disgusting’. “The kind of behaviour that happened yesterday is disgusting. Our national players need to be prioritized! Federations and Stadium Management need to understand that without our athletes there will be no Federations and no Stadiums! I will be getting to the bottom of this,” The Stadium is owned by the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing.
