The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Correspondent THE Zimbabwe Republic Police has transferred a number of officers as part of efforts to transform the organisation into a people- oriented force. In Bulawayo, most of the junior officers at Pumula Police Station were transferred to other stations. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday said there was nothing amiss with the new transfers as it was administrative. “Transfers are an administrative issue which is meant to improve performance in the system and they are also part of a task development which is meant to promote job rotation. Above all, the officers commanding provinces like in this case Bulawayo province have the responsibility of transferring non-commissioned members who would have stayed at a particular station for five years or more,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said from time to time, the ZRP transfers its officers just like any other Government department as a way of staff development. Asst Comm Nyathi said cops are also transferred so that they do not become too familiar with certain communities. “We need to consider the experience which one has, the exposure and also the need to develop somebody and this is not peculiar or unique to policing alone. “Transfers in government circles are meant to improve service delivery which then benefits the community. In our case we do not want somebody to stay at one station for 10 years,” he said. Recently, the police redeployed senior officers which saw former national police spokesperson Commissioner Charity Charamba being deployed to head the Police Staff College.—@nqotshili
