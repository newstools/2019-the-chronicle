THE Intwasa short story competition which promotes creative writing is back! After a four-year hiatus due to financial problems, the annual literary event that seeks to promote original creative writing talent in English has resurfaced and is already calling for entries. Intwasa Arts Festival koBulawayo director Raisedon Baya said: “The Intwasa Short Stories Competition is happening this year. The competition seeks to promote Zimbabwean narratives from Zimbabwean writers, be they in Zimbabwe or living in the diaspora.” He said unlike previous competitions where there was no particular theme, this year, entry stories must be about the Zimbabwean girl child, her struggles and victories. With entries set to be submitted by June 30, Baya said preferred themes are sexual harassment against the girl child, child marriages and positive models for the girl child. The winner, Baya said, will walk away with a cash prize of US$200 with two US$50 runners up prizes up for grabs. He added that entries that are open to all age groups should be original and never been published. They should have a maximum of 3 000 words and must be submitted at the Intwasa offices or on the Intwasa website. A $5 handling fee will be charged. Young female writers, Baya said, were particularly encouraged to submit their stories. Some of the previous winners of the competition include KeeTui who won the Yvonne Vera award in 2012 for the short story Tattered Cloth and Sipho Mpofu who in 2013 scooped the Yvonne Vera award for his story Balance of Power.
