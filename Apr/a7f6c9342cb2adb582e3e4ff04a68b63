The Chronicle Responses to “NO GLAMOUR FOR DEMBARE . . . A tale of two goalkeepers with contrasting fortunes”. This Chigowe guy is total crap and not a formidable coach and we said it from the word go last year. Even his outward appearance does not exhibit confidence neither is it inspiring. In short, he will never take Dembare to the promised land and a decision needs to be made now to fire him otherwise it will be another season of miserable pain for the 7 million plus supporters. Let’s not experiment with big clubs. Bambo is there, Pasuwa can be dragged from Malawi and so forth. – Eish. Response to “Government clears path for investors”. Some people just see the negative in everything. Let’s smell the coffee and be generational thinkers with a vision for the Zimbabwe we want. Let’s all, in our own little and unique ways, contribute to and add value towards attainment of that vision for the sake of future generations. Painful and disenchanting as it might be, over those lost decades, the truth is that we have had some vital lessons of both errors of commission and omission. We can learn from it. Endless grovelling and vitriol over the spilt milk, may, in my view, not add much value to the generational thinking required to take the country forward. — Gaba Rinocheka.
