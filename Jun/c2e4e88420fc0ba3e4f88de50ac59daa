The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter POPULATION Services International (PSI) has secured funding for a five-year programme to ensure Bulawayo residents access more sexual health services including breast examinations from the Nkulumane New Start Centre. According to the latest council report, residents will access the programme free of charge. Services on offer include HIV testing and counselling, voluntary medical male circumcision and family planning services. “Population Services International (PSI) and Bulawayo City Council signed a Memorandum of Understanding to award Nkulumane New Start Centre a framework subcontract in support of the Zimbabwe Sexual Reproductive Health and HIV Prevention Project and provide HIV counselling and testing services,” read the report. “Population Services International received further funding from an organisation called CIDA which will help in extending the support to the Nkulumane New Start Centre.” The local authority will bear no costs during the implementation of the project as PSI will bear all expenses. “Bulawayo residents stand to benefit immensely from this programme which will include family planning services to prevent unwanted pregnancy, voluntary male medical circumcision to prevent HIV transmission, examination of breasts to exclude cancer to reduce catastrophic costs caused by late diagnosis of cancer. The services will complement the current Visually Inspection with Acetic acid and Camera (VIAC) services for cervical cancer being provided at Nkulumane clinic,” read the report. — @thamamoe
