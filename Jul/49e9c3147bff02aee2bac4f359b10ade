The Chronicle Nkosilathi Sibanda in Gweru National Association of School Heads president Arthur Maphosa has hailed corporates for their continued support for schools netball, saying monetary incentives help generate interest in the sport at grassroots level. Maphosa said this on the sidelines of the ongoing Stella netball nationals at Thornhill High School in Gweru. Twelve schools are battling on court for the crown of the most coveted tourney in the schools calendar. “What will we do without such sponsors as Tanganda Tea Company through the Stella netball challenge? Really, we appreciate and highly commend the company for its unrivalled support to sport. What we are grateful of with regards to Tanganda Tea Company is that they have committed to sponsor the tourney for two days running every year. “In terms of development, sponsored schools sport help generate interest to play sport in our pupils. Schools that previously were unknown in sport excellence are turning the tables of history by participating and doing well. As Nash we are grateful for this,” said Maphosa. The Nash boss pointed out that out of all the netball tournaments, the Stella contest has produced champions that have gone to shine at international fora. He singled out the netball senior team as being a product of Stella netball. “If one has to give evidence of how the tournament is doing, just look at the composition of the Gems. The natonal team had more than five players produced from this tournament.  Financial support is very critical.” Meanwhile, teams finished their first round of games yesterday with the knockout stage starting early this morning. Bulawayo’s Mpopoma is touted as the tournament’s favorite, posting good results in the first round. The school beat Mabhikwa of Matabeleland North 14-7 in the opening game. They went on to thump Matabeleland South representatives Plumtree 29-11 before edging Mhangura of Mashonaland West.
