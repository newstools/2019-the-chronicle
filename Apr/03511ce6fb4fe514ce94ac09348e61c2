The Chronicle Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE cricket coach, Lalchand Rajput, has urged his side to get themselves used to winning games as they target a series whitewash against United Arab Emirates at Harare Sports Club today. The former India batsman is happy with the way the team has performed so far after racing to a 3-0 lead over the Associate Member. The coach, who endured a difficult start to his tenure last year, said he wants to make winning a habit for the side in preparation for tougher assignments. “We have won the series but we don’t take any game lightly. We just want to win all the games because we would want to make that thing a habit. “When we started off we never had a good start but since we have now started winning we would want to make winning a habit,” said Rajput. Zimbabwe were always the odds-on favourites in the four-match series, which also turn out to be UAE’s first bilateral ODI series against a Full Member. The Chevrons won the first match by seven wickets before easing to a four-run win in the second via the Duckworth/Lewis method last Friday after rains and bad light interrupted play. Zimbabwe were also on top of the situation in the third match on Sunday when they cruised to a 131-run win, thanks to a record-breaking knock for Zimbabwe’s fastest ODI century from Sean Williams and Ryan Burl’s career best 4/32. “I will not take away anything away from the UAE team because they have done reasonably well in the last few years and hopefully they will bounce back again and we are ready for it. “As I said we want our boys to play hard every game. “That has been our goal. “When we started this series we talked about it that never take any game lightly because if you look at Zimbabwe’s past performances there used to be one game played well and the next they are down. “We want that consistency (of winning games) and we are getting closer to that,” said Rajput. UAE coach Dougie Brown said his team has been learning from their mistakes.
