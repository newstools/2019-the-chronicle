The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent THIS year, the highly-rated Gwanda International Gospel Music Festival will be celebrating its fifth anniversary with event organisers saying they are working on bringing a surprise international act to commemorate the feat. For the past four years, the mining town of Gwanda in Matabeleland South province has been hosting the finest gospel show on the continent which has attracted artistes from across Zimbabwe and South Africa. Last year, SA’s Dr Tumi, Deborah Fraser and Thina Zungu joined locals Takesure Zamar, Mathias Mhere, Indosakusa and Vocal Ex. Together, they rocked Pelandaba Stadium and left those who did not manage to attend counting their losses. The free show that is bankrolled by South Africa-based businessman Justice Maphosa’s Big Time Strategic Group, is a thanksgiving to God by the mogul. Big Time Strategic Group spokesperson, Mthokozisi Dube, said this year’s festival would be special. “We’ve identified some of the artistes that we want to bring through and they’re really excited. The festival is going to be bigger this year and different because we’re putting together a unique programme seeing that it’s our fifth anniversary,” said Dube. “We shall have a surprise act as we want to bring someone who’s not from Africa.” He said with this year’s festival, that will most probably be held in mid- September, they want to show how grateful they (event organisers) are to God. “We want to reflect our gratitude to God for what he has done for us over the last four years. We owe everything to God who has made it possible for us to continuously host the festival each year,” said Dube.
