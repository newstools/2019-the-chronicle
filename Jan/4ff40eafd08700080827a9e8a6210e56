The Chronicle Response to “Government dismayed by doctors’ stance despite concessions . . . Moves to restore normalcy”. We the taxpayers demand that they should listen to our grievances. Our tax pays their salaries. They should stop airing their grievance in darkness and speak to us in broad daylight. – Peump. Response to “Let’s remain focused — ED”. Bravo Mr President! We all have a duty to play in the creation of the Zimbabwe we want. We should all put the harmonised elections of July 30, 2018 behind us, and concentrate on our burdened economy. Politics, politics and more politics is a recipe for disaster for us as a nation. Rebuilding the economy requires input from all of us regardless of political affiliation, ethnic and religious background. – Muchaneta Tagwa. Response to “Economy has potential to recover”. True, everything will be all right soon. We need to be patient. Let’s give it months and witness great changes with the measures our Government put in place for 2019. — Anold Tinoda Mupfawi.
