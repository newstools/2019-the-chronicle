The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter ZIFA Bulawayo province acting chairman, Allan “Ripper” Mpofu, has called on teams to practice fair play when the Bulawayo Province Cup round of 16 games get underway tomorrow. Mpofu was speaking at the draw for the last 16 matches at the Zifa offices on Thursday. The Bulawayo Province Cup is a competition for Division Two and Division Three teams. A total of 32 teams participated in the initial stage of the inaugural competition. “We are happy with how the tournament has started. We urge teams to practice fair play and let football be the winner. This is our first tournament, it’s important that everyone supports this initiative as we aim to see the tournament growing bigger,” said Mpofu. He said after realising there will be a surplus from the funds raised from registration fees, they felt it would be in the interest of the teams to come up with a knock-out tournament. The winner is set to walk away with $2 500, while the first runner-up will bag $1 000 and second runner-up $500. Next Level Sports chipped in with $500 to make the first prize $2 500 after the province had budgeted $2 000 for the winners, while Body Works Gym committed to sponsor the Top Goal Scorer and Player of the Tournament’s individual prizes.
