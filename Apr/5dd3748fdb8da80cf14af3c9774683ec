The Chronicle Michelle Gwizi, Chronicle Reporter THREE men from Bulawayo allegedly robbed a woman from Kumalo suburb of 143 grammes of gold, US$2 000, RTGS $6 000, R25 000, a silver pocket scale and two cell phones. One of the suspects, Richfield Mpofu, yesterday pleaded not guilty to an armed robbery charge when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate, Mr Franklin Mkhwananzi. He was remanded in custody to April 24 for provision of a trial date. Prosecuting Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said on April 5 this year at around 2PM, Mpofu with two accomplices who are still at large, hired a black Honda Fit which was being driven by Mr Innocent Mahlangu. “They went to the complainant Ms Priviledge Ndlovu’s place of residence and entered the house pretending they wanted to sell her six grammes of gold. “They were offered RTGS$75 and after the transaction they produced firearms and demanded cash. “Mpofu stole 143 grammes of gold, US$2 000, $6 000RTGS, 25 000ZAR, a silver pocket scale and two cell phones which belonged to Ms Ndlovu and went away,” said Mr Dlodlo. He said Ms Ndlovu screamed for help. Mpofu and his accomplices climbed over a perimeter wall firing shots in the air to scare neighbours who had come out to offer assistance. “Mahlangu was frightened by the gun shots and started the engine trying to run away before the accused persons boarded the car. Mpofu shot the left rear wheel forcing the driver to stop. “Having stopped they threatened to shoot him if he did not listen to them. They drove off and disembarked along the Bulawayo-Harare road,” said Mr Dlodlo. Police received a tip off leading to them picking up Mr Mahlangu. Follow ups were made leading to them picking up Mpofu who was found in possession of 3 200ZAR, $105RTGS, US$10 and a pistol with an erased serial number charged with 12 rounds of ammunition. The money and firearm were produced as exhibits in court. – @gwizi_n
