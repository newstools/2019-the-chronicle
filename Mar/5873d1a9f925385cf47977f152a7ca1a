The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter BULAWAYO comedy club Umahlekisa will this Friday celebrate their sixth anniversary at Hope Centre (opposite Central Police station). Comedians Cskanyiso Dat Guy, Zwe, Ntando Van Moyo and Babongile Skhonjwa are billed to crack ribs with Hip Hop musician Cal Vin also set to perform. Tickets are pegged at RTGS$10 with the event scheduled to begin at 7:30 PM. Six years ago, Ntando Van Moyo realised that there was need for comedy shows in Bulawayo. But in order to have shows, comedians were needed so he came up with Umahlekisa to give up-and-coming comedians a platform to perform and nurture their talents while entertaining the Bulawayo populace. From this club, standup comedians including Clive Chigubu and Mandla Da Comedian have been identified and have won awards. Top Harare and South African comedians have also performed at Umahlekisa shows. Ntando Van Moyo said: “We’ve come a long way and we’re growing from strength to strength. Every year, we’re uncovering great standup comedians and it’s been a great six-year journey. “People should come and join us as we celebrate this milestone on Friday.” Van Moyo said it has not been a smooth journey as he faced so many challenges. “We’ve had financial problems, situations where comedians do not show up for shows and lack of audiences but we’ve learnt from all these challenges,” he said. For the next six years, the founder said he hopes they will have a physical space where they will host shows and groom young talent. “We also hope to have a Zimbabwean channel dedicated to comedy, just like Comedy Central on DStv.”
