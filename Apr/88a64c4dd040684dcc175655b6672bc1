The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau BEITBRIDGE Municipality has started implementing a number of capital projects meant to change the face of the border town. Town Clerk Mr Loud Ramakgapola said that they were asking businesses to complement the work of council by sprucing up their buildings. He said the town has been growing rapidly in the last decade and as such council was upgrading the infrastructure to meet the demands of a growing town. “We are working on pavements in the Central Business District among other projects meant to change the face of our town,” he said. Mr Ramakgapola said efforts were being made to make the border town an investment destination of choice. “We are strategically located to attract a lot of investment,” he said.
