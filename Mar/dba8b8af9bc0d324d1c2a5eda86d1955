MORE and more Zimdancehall musicians are making their way to Bulawayo as the city is slowly embracing the genre that is being popularised by ghetto youths in Harare. From the beginning of the year, fast-rising artistes Jah Signal and Enzo Ishall have been frequenting the city as they seek to grow their brands nationally. Interestingly, all the shows they have hosted at venues like The Vista, Cosmopolitan and BAC Leisure have attracted full houses â€“ showing that they are in demand in the city. Joining these two this weekend is Killer T who will be putting his popularity in the city to the test with a performance at The Vista tonight. The Vista events coordinator, Themba Sibanda, said they had invited Killer T to perform again after he wowed fans at their venue last year. He said all was in place for the event with university and college students set to pay less to enter if they produce their student identification cards at the gates. Tickets have been pegged at $10 for general admission and $7 for students. Killer T, who released Ane Chaanogona track this week, is expected to perform the track at the event where he will be supported by Cue Movement DJs Raftoe, Ncanez, and Moze.
