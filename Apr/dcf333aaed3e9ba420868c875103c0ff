The Chronicle Lisa Mangena, Court Reporter A 27-YEAR-OLD woman from Bulawayo who is suspected to be HIV positive has appeared in court for allegedly luring a 16- year-old boy into having sex with her. The woman from Emganwini suburb, who cannot be named for ethical reasons, allegedly had sex with her neighbour after she asked him to help her carry firewood. She appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Lungile Ncube on Saturday and pleaded not guilty to a charge of aggravated indecent assault. The woman was remanded in custody to April 4 for commencement of trial. In her defence, she said she only talked to the teen about the kind of men she liked. The court heard that the accused lured the teen as they were carrying firewood by telling him the types of men she enjoyed having sex with and later caressed him and had unprotected sex with him. Prosecuting, Mr Kenneth Shava said before the incident, the accused would send messages to the minor telling him about the kind of men she liked and how she enjoyed sex. “As the two talked on the phone, accused would tell the minor that she actually deals with men older than the minor,” he said. Mr Shava said on March 2 at around 3PM, the woman called the teen and asked him to help her carry firewood into their home. “After carrying the last batch, accused caressed the minor. She undressed herself and had sex with the teen who later pushed her away, left the room and ran away. “The teen jumped over a durawall (precast wall) and went home,” he said. The court heard that on the following day, the teen saw accused’s friend and she told him she knew he had sex with the accused. She also told the minor that the accused is HIV positive before telling the minor’s father about the abuse. A police report was made and the minor was taken for medical examinations. —@LissahMangena
