The Chronicle Saul Gwakuba Ndlovu, Correspondent A stalwart of  Zimbabwe’s armed liberation struggle, Cde Enock Thaka, has died and he will be buried today at Lady Stanley Cemetery in Bulawayo. Cde Thaka (90) died at his Burnside residence last Friday after a long illness. He joined the National Democratic Party’s youth league in 1960. In the following year he joined the NDP’s successor, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (Zapu), after the NDP was outlawed by the Rhodesian administration. Cde Thaka was then working for the Rhodesia Railways and later transferred to the then Northern Rhodesia, later Zambia. When Zapu was also proscribed in September 1962 they decided to go underground to wage an armed liberation struggle, with Zambia as its rear base. Cde Thaka’s house at Choma in Zambia’s southern province became an important supplies base for Zapu guerrillas operating in the Choma, Kariba, Livingstone, Chirundu sector. Cde Scotch (actual name Bulukanui Timothy Masola) who was heading the Choma sector, worked closely with Cde Thaka and his wife. At times Cde Scotch would use Cde Thaka’s vehicle in the extremely dangerous operational area.
