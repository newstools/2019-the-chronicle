UP-AND-COMING Gwanda based reggae artiste, Bry, has earned himself a collaboration with Guspy Warrior in the latter’s single to be released on Valentine’s Day. The rowdy protests which were experienced mid-month around the country led to the single release being put on hold. Reggae music is one of the unifying genres as highlighted by Bob Marley and Lucky Dube’s music. Guspy Warrior wants to unite the nation through collaborating with more artistes from the Matabeleland region. The single which is a hard party song is aimed at closing the gap between Matebeleland based and Mashonaland based reggae artistes. Born Brighton Moyo in rural Gwanda, Bry, said he is honoured to have been chosen for a collabo by a role model in his musical journey. “I am humbled and honoured to have the opportunity of featuring in Guspy’s upcoming single,” said Bry. The talented young musician who has shown growth in his live performances, last December left pupils from Sabiwa High School asking for more after his show. The Bry/Guspy collabo single was recorded in Bulawayo and Harare and produced by TMan of Mount Zion Records. Speaking from his base in Harare, Guspy Warrior said he wants to use the reggae genre to unify the nation at large and also popularising it in small towns. “We want to put the past behind us in light of the past events and want to create a united nation. “I thank Bulawayo based producer Nasty B for linking me up with the Bry and call upon fans especially from small towns to give up-and-coming artistes all the support they deserve,” Guspy Warrior said. He also challenged young artistes to produce high quality works. Guspy Warrior said he is looking forward to holding a show in Gwanda. “I have never performed in Gwanda but now that I have this collabo, I’ll organise one,” he said. — @mthabisi_mthire
