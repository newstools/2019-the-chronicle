The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent DJ Prince Eskhosini is over the moon following his nomination at the Bulawayo Arts Awards (BAA) as his hard work is finally being recognised. It’s been a long time since DJ Prince started wheel spinning. It all started 23 years ago during a school leaver’s party at Mpopoma High School and ever since, the BAC Leisure DJ has not looked back. Reflecting on this nomination in the Outstanding Club DJ category, DJ Prince said he was happy and humbled. “I’ve been doing this (Deejaying) for the past 22 years and to get recognition for undertaking what you love shows that your works are being noticed by people, which is quite encouraging,” he said. Other than Deejaying, DJ Prince from time to time, records and produces music. He released his debut album in 2000 and recently, he released a track titled Siphuza Noma Yini which patrons have been jamming to at BAC. His other works include a dancehall remix of R‘n’B songstress Alaina’s song Juice Box and a dancehall remix of rapper POY’s Dirty Game. The success of Siphuza Noma Yini and nomination at the BAAs have spurred him to work on more songs. “Next week DJ Prince will be in Gweru where he will perform at the Ultimate Ice Cooler Box Party. He will share the stage with DJ Trill Angel, Patch, Ray Vine and rapper Kikky BadA$$.
