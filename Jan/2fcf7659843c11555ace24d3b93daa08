MAMBO music video was not a high budget one but took the ingenuity of young artistes who came together to produce a product that was voted the Zim Hip Hop Best music video. It was a vibe! That’s how to describe the music video which shows Asaph’s celebratory mood after bagging the Outstanding Hip Hop act at the Bulawayo Arts Awards. The track produced by Zim hip Hop best producer Rayo Beats, needed a complementary music video that would capture what he was feeling. However, in a country where quality music video producers are expensive, Asaph and crew had to think outside the box. Luckily the music video producer Blaqink Creates loved the song and wanted to jump on the bandwagon the moment he heard that Asaph was contemplating producing one. What the music video prodcuer wanted was only he and his equipment to be transported from his home in Nkulumane and back. One of Asaph’s associates Leeroy “Roy” Mufudzi used his car and drove to collect the music video producer and his equipment. Thereafter everything worked like according to plan. The crew identified what they call a ‘Trap House’ on the outskirts of the Bulawayo CBD where most scenes of the music video were shot. Special mention should be made to the artistes who featured on Mambo, Tha Dawgg and Fish F McSwagg, they really laid the chorus good. Back to the music video, the cast was drawn from friends of the crew and they were told to wear something black. Drinks and food were bought and they started off not by shooting but setting the partying and congratulatory mood right by downing the drinks, singing and dancing to some music. When that was over and the drinks were flowing, that’s when the music video producer started shooting scenes. The rest they say is history.
