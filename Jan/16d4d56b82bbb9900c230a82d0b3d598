THE Zimbabwe national baseball team has appealed to the nation to rally behind them in their bid to qualify for Tokyo 2020. Zimbabwe will face South Africa, Botswana and Namibia in the Olympic qualifiers in April and last week held a week-long training session at Hamilton High School, Bulawayo ahead of the continental Games set for South Africa. National team coach Washington Nyika said: “We encourage fans in the country to support the national team in their quest to qualify for Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Together we can make it possible as long as we rally behind the team and encourage the players. “The bottom line is to make every citizen aware that there’s a team that needs support and that will go out there to represent Zimbabwe with pride.” The first time Zimbabwean baseball team featured in the All-Africa Games was in 1999 in the 7th All-Africa Games in South Africa and for the second and last time, in 2003, in the 8th All-Africa Games in Nigeria. — @DecoDecent2
