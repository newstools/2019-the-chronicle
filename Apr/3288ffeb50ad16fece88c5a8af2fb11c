The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter “Dare to dream and be brave enough to take opportunities when they come your way”. This is the advice of gospel sensation, Mkhululi Bhebhe who is making a name for himself abroad. The 34-year-old’s  musical breakthrough came through DStv’s Idols Africa show back in 2008 when he was among the show’s top six. This gave him exposure and he found himself joining the South African gospel ensemble, Joyous Celebration Choir. Through Joyous, Mkhululi who has since left the choir to pursue a solo career, rose to fame with Zimbabwean hit songs such as Tambira Jehovah, Ichokwadi, Namata, Hakuna Zvinorema and Zvamaronga. Reflecting on his participation on Idols Africa, Mkhululi said: “My Idols Africa experience made me realise I could actually make something out of my talent.  At that time I had no idea that singing alone could open opportunities for me and take me to countries such as South Africa. “It’s been an amazing journey that all started with a single opportunity provided by MultiChoice Zimbabwe,” said Mkhululi Turning to reality shows like Big Brother Africa and Idols that are run by DStv, Mkhululi said: “I encourage Zimbabweans to grab all these opportunities and run with them because you never know when the tipping point will be. I’m a living testimony of how such opportunities can change one’s life. “I’ve travelled the world because of the opportunity opened for me which I took advantage of,” he said. In December 2017, Mkhululi recorded his first self-funded live solo CD and DVD in South Africa. He released the album last year in Bulawayo at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair to great acclaim. Some of the much-loved songs on the CD and DVD include Kuyangimangaza, Zvamaronga, A bung Neng (The Good Name) and Ndiyeyu Jesu Medley. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-443829" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Mkhululi-Bhebhe-Pic-2-360x296.jpg" alt="" width="743" height="611" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Mkhululi-Bhebhe-Pic-2-360x296.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/Mkhululi-Bhebhe-Pic-2.jpg 667w" sizes="(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px" /> Mkhululi has during the past 10 years toured 23 countries including Trinidad and Tobago, China, USA, the United Kingdom and New Zealand as a solo artiste. On the continent, his career has taken him to Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland. “I believe music is a universal language that can cut across any culture. In the future, I see myself rising as a voice on global issues affecting society. “I believe I’ve been given this platform so that I can be a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves like children suffering from hunger and abuse, the elderly, women and men in need. With the help of initiatives from MultiChoice, I believe this is an achievable goal that can begin right here at home in Zimbabwe and spread across Africa and even the rest of the world. “I believe in using my influence to promote global peace and harmony,” he said. The musician also believes Zimbabweans have the talent, ambition and determination to shine on local and global stages. “Zimbabweans are claiming their rightful spot on modern reality television and I’m proud to name myself among these reality stars. I remember in the 2008 season of DStv’s Idols Africa in which I participated, 50 percent of the Top 10 participants were Zimbabweans. “This showed that Zimbabweans thrive when it comes to such things and all we need is an opportunity. Even on DStv’s Big Brother Africa, Zimbabweans have consistently been among the cream of the crop. I’d love to see more reality series coming from Zimbabwe because I believe our people have a very rich story to tell.” Mkhululi encouraged all young Zimbabweans, no matter their personal circumstances, to remain steadfast in their dreams and never give up. “To those people who feel like they’re standing on the edge of the world, remember, where there is life, there’s always hope. Just keep on believing and never let anything take away your dreams. “It costs you absolutely nothing to dream. You’re allowed to dream, in fact, you must dream but you must also safeguard your dreams. I honestly believe only dreamers can change the world and that’s what we need in our country: dreamers with the potential to change the world.” MultiChoice Zimbabwe said they would continue supporting the local arts, entertainment and creative industry through its sponsorship of the Zimbabwe International Film Festival Trust, International Images Film Festival For Women, Shoko Festival and Ngoma Awards, all of which encourage Zimbabweans to tell their stories.
