The Chronicle Business Reporter THE Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) is aiming to leverage on the 60th edition of ZITF, which kicked off Tuesday in Bulawayo, to increase the drive on MICE tourism through A’Sambeni Tourism Fair. A’Sambeni is taking place at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre, popularly known as the ZITF grounds, until Saturday 27 April. The fair is a forum, which strives to place Zimbabwe as a preferred destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE). ZTA’s acting chief executive, Mrs Rita Likukuma said the national tourism organisation was promoting MICE tourism as it had promised that it can sustain the tourism economy, which when the country went through a bad patch, mostly the tourism sector generated income through MICE business. “A’Sambeni’s timing is to our advantage as most companies both local and international will be exhibiting at the international trade showcase, which means most of the decision makers will be converged at one place,” she said. “This will give them exposure to gather more intelligence on incentive travel as well as conferencing and events, which we hope in future will bear fruits as it has managed to make the tourism industry stay afloat in previous years.” The ZTA is also taking advantage of ZITF this year to rollout its domestic tourism campaign as it also aims to educate the locals on tourism. With tourism operators under one roof one can even go a step further to make enquiries and have an in-depth appreciation of tourism products, said the authority.
