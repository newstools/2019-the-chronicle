The Chronicle Runesu Gwidi, Masvingo Correspondent A BID for freedom by a 23-year-old trainee nurse who was allegedly caught red-handed raping an 89 year-old patient at Mashoko Mission Hospital in Bikita District hit a brick wall yesterday after he was denied bail at the High Court. Justice Neville Wamambo turned down an application for bail pending trial by Costa Madzvamuse who is being represented by Mr Omen Mafa of Mutendi, Mudisi and Shumba Legal Practitioners. Madzvamuse who was tasked to take care and monitor the patient in the isolated hospital ward, allegedly raped her on September 24 at around 4pm. He allegedly raped the patient two months before completing his nurse training course. The complainant and another nurse at the hospital who allegedly saw Madzvamuse committing the offence, positively identified him. Madzvamuse allegedly closed both doors and windows of the ward, proceeded to the patient’s bed, lowered his pair of trousers to knee-level and raped her once. One of the nurses peeped through a curtain, saw him in action and ordered him to open the doors. The nurses at the hospital later reported the matter to police leading to Madzvamuse’s arrest.
