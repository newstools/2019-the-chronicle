The Chronicle Editor — I am disgusted by what l picked up in The Chronicle in recent days. The issue was about what often delays court cases. Pre-Trial. Legal jargon concerning defence lawyers dwelling on conduct of State personnel in carrying out arrests, evidential matter and procedural issues. Doesn’t the office of the Attorney General know about these? Anything that delays justice is useless law. In Zimbabwe, crimes committed are so obvious they get topical. People are released on bail when their crimes are displayed before the public. Next you see every detail melt and the case just evaporates. This is exactly why known thugs and corrupt people boast because they gain a lot from committing crimes. We cannot allow known disturbing circumstances that afford criminals a chance to escape from the tentacles of the law. The AG must attend to this, its urgent.
