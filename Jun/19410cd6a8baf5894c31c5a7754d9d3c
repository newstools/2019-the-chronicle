The Chronicle US President Donald Trump says Queen Elizabeth II had the time of her life in his company during a state visit to the UK this week. Reflecting on his trip to Europe in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Friday, Trump boasted about his connection with the Queen, who entertained the president at Buckingham Palace. During the 16-minute interview, Trump said he and the Queen, who turned 93 earlier this year, had such an involved conversation at the state banquet in his honour, that he did not know who else was sat at the table. “There are those that say they have never seen the Queen have a better time, a more animated time,” he said, but did not elaborate on who these people were. “We had a period we were talking solid straight, I didn’t even know who the other people at the table were, never spoke to them. We just had a great time together.” Trump added: “The meeting with the Queen was incredible. I think I can say I really got to know her because I sat with her many times and we had automatic chemistry, you will understand that feeling. It’s a good feeling. But she’s a spectacular woman.” During the banquet on Monday, the Queen took a subtle jab at Trump’s politics while standing right next to the president. “While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace,” she said, it what could be seen as a reference to Trump’s more protectionist agenda. – AP
