The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter Jah Prayzah has been hailed by many for his use of voluptuous women and local locations in his recent music videos. Most artistes world over prefer using slender video vixens but Jah Prayzah seems to be turning that around. In his Kune Rima video that was released recently, Jah Prayzah featured the voluptuous MisRed. For his Chikomo video that was released yesterday, he further made people appreciate curvaceous women by featuring two beautiful plus size women. Directed by Vusa Blaqs, buzz had been created for the music video on social media through an image of Jah Prayzah wearing a long garment that had a veil. Some had begun criticising him for his dress sense which seemed feminine. When he dropped the video on YouTube yesterday, the long garment made sense as it represented religion. On the video, the musician’s struggles are metaphorically captured as he is seen being tied and strangled with chains by a mysterious masked man in the jungle. This highlights the message behind the song which speaks about the musician’s hardships. The pain, anguish and prayers were captured well through visuals. Explaining the song and its video, Jah Prayzah said: “Chikomo is a song where I thank the Almighty for guiding, protecting and blessing me even though there are some who have thrown stones in my path. Every day, we go through life problems and struggles. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-442217" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-4-5-360x240.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-4-5-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-4-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-4-5-680x453.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Untitled-4-5.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> “These problems differ from one person to the other. It might be hate, being pulled down when you’re trying to progress, cyber bullying, financial or even family problems. What’s important is knowing that there’s a God in Heaven. In all that we do, if we put God first, the enemy will be overpowered.” “I love Chikomo as it speaks to me, it talks about my life.” After recording Dzamutsana in Binga last year, Jah Prayzah chose Mutarazi Falls in Nyanga and the dam side in Kariba for Chikomo video. The choice of tourist attractions, he said, was deliberate as he wants to promote the country’s tourism destinations through his music videos. “Zimbabwe is big and I feel it’s time we start promoting different areas so people, both locally and internationally, have an appreciation of our country. As musicians, we’re the country’s ambassadors so we’re the best to enlighten people about what our country has to offer through music,” Jah Prayzah said. Appreciating the scenery, one Tanaka M commented: “Sometimes you wonder if these places where the video was shot are in Zimbabwe. I see God’s amazing work when He created a beautiful country (naturally) like Zimbabwe. Nyanga and Kariba’s beauty cannot be disputed.” Hours after its release, the Chikomo video had more than 60 000 views on YouTube with many people giving it thumbs up. Others said Jah Prayzah could have not released the video at a better time. “This video came out at the right time considering what Zimbabwe has gone through . . . Cyclone Idai.The deeper meanings of this song can make you cry. Lord please do what you always do best, heal our nation.” Director Vusa Blaqs said: “We took about five days brainstorming ideas and concepts for the video as we really wanted to bring out the struggles people go through in a not so obvious way.” He said they first shot the video in Nyanga about a month ago but they did not have enough footage and they looked for another location which was Kariba. This latest music video is the fourth video for songs on the Chitubu album.
