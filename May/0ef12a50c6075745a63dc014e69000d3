The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter A former Northlea High School pupil Vusi Nyathi yesterday donated sets of basketball and hockey kit to his former school. Nyathi, who is now based in Canada, was donating for the second year running after giving the school basketball kit for the junior team in 2018. “My experience playing basketball at Northlea has been one of the best moments of my life and the least I can do is to return the favour. I believe basketball and sport in general promotes and drives a lifetime friendship,” said Nyathi. “I got a lifelong attachment to the school as it gave me a foundation for discipline. With the help of Mentor College and Stoney Creek Basketball Academy I got these sets of  kit for the basketball and hockey teams,” he said. Speaking on behalf of the school, a senior teacher Precious Malinga applauded Nyathi, whom she taught from 1990 to 1994. “Vusi (Nyathi) has been consistent in giving back to the school. His selfless gesture is inspiring and motivating to young learners as it promotes a culture of giving,” said Malinga. Nyathi said he will continue supporting his former school and will try to rally other ex-students based in the diaspora to join the initiative. “I’m happy to have donated this in front of the learners despite the fact that they’re on holiday, as I seek to inspire the young ones and bring about a culture of working together in empowering our communities,” Nyathi said. — @DecoDecent2
