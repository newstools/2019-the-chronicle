Bulawayo Chief Fire Officer Mr Richard Peterson said a woman died on the spot while 21 others were seriously injured. “I can confirm we received a report of a road accident that occurred at the Fort Rixon turn-off along the Bulawayo- Harare Road. “The first party was driving towards Bulawayo while the other was driving towards Harare. “Upon approaching the Fort Rixon turn-off, one of them attempted to overtake resulting in a head-on collision,” he said. Mr Peterson urged drivers to exercise caution saying it was sad to note an upsurge in fatal road accidents caused by human error.
