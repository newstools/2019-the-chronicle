The Chronicle Andile Tshuma, Chronicle Reporter POLICE recently intercepted goods worth more than RTGS $170 000 which are suspected to have been smuggled into the country through the Beitbridge Border Post. Patrol teams made up of Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) officials and police officers deployed along the Beitbridge- Harare and Beitbridge-Bulawayo highways intercepted the goods. The joint operation between ZIMRA and police started last week and will soon be spread to other areas to curb smuggling of goods. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed that the police were working with ZIMRA to fight smuggling. He warned people smuggling goods that the long arm of the law will soon catch up with them. “The Zimbabwe Republic Police has realised that some bus crews, kombi drivers or omalayitsha are smuggling goods thereby prejudicing Government of large amounts of money. We are therefore working with ZIMRA and the Immigration Department to curb smuggling at our border posts,” said Ass Comm Nyathi. He urged members of the public to co-operate with the police and other relevant arms of Government involved in the exercise to curb smuggling. “We are definitely spreading this operation across the country’s borders but we will not specify the period as this will alert offenders. The operation is ongoing and will spread to all ports of entry. Members of the public are therefore urged to fully comply with the Customs and Excise laws and processes when importing goods into the country,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. He said a number of buses and private cars caught with smuggled goods have since been impounded.— @andile_tshuma
