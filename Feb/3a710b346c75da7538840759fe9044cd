FIVE games are lined up for this weekend’s Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association League 1 and 2. All focus will be at BAC where Bulawayo Athletics Club host Queens Cricket Club in a League 1 match. Another interesting encounter is that featuring log leaders Emakhandeni Cricket Club and Roosters at Queens Sports Club. Emakhandeni go into the game with a weakened side, as a number of their top players are doing duty for Tuskers in the Logan Cup in Harare. Bulawayo Metropolitan Cricket Association chairman Vumindaba Moyo said apart from the sporadic fuel shortages, everything else was in order. “Our machines for maintaining the grounds are motorised, so we seriously need fuel to ensure everything goes according to the schedule. We’re also hopeful tomorrow’s (today) weather will be friendly because the rains will complicate everything. We hope the fuel situation will be manageable in the coming days for us to have a smooth sailing league programme,” said Moyo. “We’re appealing to members of the public to come and support our teams at various venues. Teams have brought in new talented players to reinforce their squads so the fight for supremacy is expected to be a notch higher.” In League 2, Nust face Queens Cricket Club 2 at BAC, while Tigers meet Lupane State University at the Heath Streak Cricket Academy and Nketa Cricket Club welcome Emakhandeni 2.
