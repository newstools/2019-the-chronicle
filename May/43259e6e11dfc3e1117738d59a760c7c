The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter PRIZE money will be up for grabs at the 7th Annual Muscle and Fitness Open Classic event for 2019 to be held at Cathedral Hall in Gweru on May 25. The event is dedicated to celebrating classic physique, fitness and raw power. Muscle & Fitness Gym was founded in 2005 as part of Vann Gopal Engineering’s programme to give back to the community. Gym manager Alice Hunyenyiwa said it’s been a while since they held a public event and they’ve been getting calls from the public to hold the event. She said the winners will get “good money” in United States dollars. “It’s a club aimed at giving back to the community. The muscle and fitness open classic provides competent and less privileged athletes with a platform to compete. We successfully hosted the event between 2005-2010 before taking a break as the industry had some challenges. We’re hosting again in response to calls from athletes,” said Hunyenyiwa. She said the competition is open to all members of the public. The competition will see participants fighting for honours in four categories, with juniors below 21 years vying for the top price in the junior category. The second category is light weight, below 70kg, middle weight between 70-80kg and light heavy weight between 80-90kg. The other ones are female fitness and power lifting competition – bench press and dead lift.  — @DecoDecent20
