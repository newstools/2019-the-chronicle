Jiyane said he is going there to assist in reviving tennis in Gwanda town as it will play a huge part in promoting sports in the country. “We’ve been getting a lot of support from Gwanda when they brought a number of players to compete against our players in our tournaments. Thus, as a club we tasked ourselves to return the favour and ensure that they’re pro-active in tennis,” said Jiyane. He said his club has been getting rackets and balls from Tennis Aid Spain and National Tennis Development (NTD) Global of which they intend to pass some of the donations to a club in the Matabeleland South capital. “Emakhandeni Tennis is in a quest of identifying and promoting talent and the two organisations, (Tennis Aid Spain and NTD Global), have made it possible for us to manage the process of reviving the club. We’re so glad that some individuals in Gwanda have provided the kids with a platform to follow their passion.” “Our goal is to see the region producing passionate and dedicated players who will go on to represent the country in international competitions. By so doing, there will be an inspiration to the future generation who will find something to build on,” he said. Gwanda Tennis Academy coach Mtshutshisi Mathema said they invited Jiyane to help their club on various aspects of the game. “Emakhandeni have been there and they’ve a lot of history. This is why we asked them to come and impart skills and inspire our youngsters. We’re targeting players below the age of 15 since the idea is to groom them from a young age,” said Mathema. — @DecoDecent2
