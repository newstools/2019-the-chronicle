The Chronicle Thandeka Moyo, Health Reporter THE Ear Centre, a private hearing healthcare services provider, is conducting free outreach programmes on hearing loss for Bulawayo residents which will stretch up to June this year. According to the latest council minutes, the programme started on April 28 and the last one will be held on June 9, 2019. “We, as The Ear Centre, hereby tender our application to conduct a community outreach in the different locations in the city of Bulawayo. With your approval we hope to educate the community on hearing loss problems and contribute to their well-being,” read the minutes. The outreach programme will be accessible from Nketa, Hillside, Nkulumane and Northend suburbs. “We will have our first outreach programme at Nketa Clinic followed by one at Hillside Primary School. On May 26 we will have an outreach at Nkulumane Clinic and then our last programme will be on June 9 at the Northern Suburbs Clinic” read the statement. The Ear Centre will be conducting hearing screening tests to the communities free of charge. The director of Health Services, Dr Edwin Sibanda, said the outreach would be a way of assessing how people lost their hearing ability due to medication they may have been taking or other injuries. “After the screening process people will be assisted with accessories such as hearing aids and they will get recommendations if there is a need for further medical attention,” he said. Dr Sibanda added that this initiative, depending on the turnout and findings, would be recommended for a city wide screening in the near future. — @thamamoe
