A ROMANTIC drama Another Wedding? which features a mix of veteran and up-and-coming actors from Bulawayo including Sarah Mpofu, Precious Makhulumo and Memory Kumbota, is set to premiere on Zambezi Magic (DStv Channel 160). The hour-long film that is set in Bulawayo is about a single, career woman Bonke Dlamini, who is challenged by society’s expectations of women in their late 20s. Fortunately for Bonke, she meets her ideal man who is equally hard working. However, in the midst of her romance with her prince charming, another woman surfaces and the story takes a turn. The film, which was recorded within a month, is based on a story written by Ntombikamama Moyo, Peacemore Manhanga, Pure Chinyakuza and Anita Malumisa using the collabowriters process. (Collabowriters is a relay authoring initiative where writers take turns to write one story). It was produced by Kudzai Chikomo and directed by Willard Nyandoro and features new blood on the acting scene in the form of Charmaine Mudau and Calvin Madula. Another Wedding? is an engaging love story which we hope will teach viewers about forgiveness in the face of betrayal and hurt,” said Chikomo. The producer said they were now waiting on Zambezi Magic to set the premiere date. Award-winning poet Albert Nyathi endorsed the film saying: “It’s a scintillating love story from new voices. It captured my imagination.” Scriptwriter, Christopher Mlalazi said: “This story explores the complexities of romantic relationships in the modern, urban age and offsets that starkly with traditional ways of falling in love, getting married and the expectations of parents and society.”
