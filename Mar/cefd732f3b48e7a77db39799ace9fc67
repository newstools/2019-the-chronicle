The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter LADIES, get out of your hiding space as the search for the face of one of Bulawayo’s up-market nightspots, Cosmopolitan nightclub, is on. With models already flocking in for the auditions, the pageant, which is being run by Elegance Steps Modelling and Arts Agency (ESMAA), will take place at the Ascot Racecourse on March 30. Fashion designer Method Nsingo, who is one of the organisers, said the event was being held to promote the city’s models. “We believe that our models are not being given enough support like those in other cities so we hope the pageant will go a long way in addressing that,” Nsingo said. “The show is also aimed at entertaining fashion and modelling enthusiasts who are starved of such entertainment in the city.” Hosted by musician POY and King Meth, event attendees will be entertained by the Rollex crew, DJ Zillion, Power FM DJ Emity Smooth, Mzoe 7, KeazyAM and Kead Wikead.
