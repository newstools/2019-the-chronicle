THE Chicken Inn couple – Belinda Nyoni and Makhosana Mguni – is back in the limelight with a Chicken Inn Valentine’s Day campaign which they are spearheading countrywide. The couple that was made famous after Makhosana proposed to Belinda at the Chicken Inn Drive Thru outlet in Bulawayo last year, clinched an endorsement deal with the outlet because of the gesture that had initially been mocked by some. On Monday, as part of the deal, their images were splashed on the front pages of the country’s flagship newspapers – The Herald and The Chronicle as well as social media – something most local personalities can only dream of. Their images were part of adverts of the Luv Dat Chick Valentine’s Day competition that is being run by the outlet. To be part of the competition, couples need to share their love story which they think is as inspirational as the Makho and Belinda one on the Chicken Inn Zimbabwe Facebook page. The winning couple is set to walk away with a fully sponsored weekend getaway and the winners will be announced on February 28. In addition, the couple has also inspired what the outlet is calling a Couple’s Combo Meal where two Two Piecers are being sold at an affordable price. The couple, widely known as #IcoupleYaBantu has been an inspiration to many young couples as they had the nation talking about their proposal. Makhosana went on bended knee in December last year and asked Belinda for her hand in marriage. A picture of him proposing went viral and caught Chicken Inn management’s attention, leading to them being made brand ambassadors.
