MIDLANDS province has been hit by an outbreak of the fall armyworm adding gloom to the maize crop already showing signs of moisture stress due to the prolonged dry spell. The fall armyworm has reportedly affected the entire province, a situation that has sent farmers into panic. In an interview, Midlands Provincial Crop and Livestock officer Mrs Madlinah Magwenzi said the pests have left many farmers counting losses. “The province has been hit by the outbreak of fall armyworm and the situation is very bad. As a department we have been conducting crop assessment and the results will be ready by end of February,” she said. Mrs Magwenzi said Government has dispatched extension officers to help farmers. “Our extension officers have been dispatched to various areas to train and help farmers on how to deal with the pests. “They are also advising farmers on which pesticides to use,” she said. Mrs Magwenzi urged farmers to also use the traditional method of controlling fall armyworm. “At this point in time it is crucial that farmers adhere to traditional methods of controlling army worms which is scouting in the morning and in the evening. We haven’t found a proper pesticide with proper ingredients for fall armyworm control,” she said. Mrs Magwenzi said Government’s research department is busy carrying out research for a strong fall armyworm pesticide. Last year, the province was also hit by a serious outbreak of fall armyworm, wiping out 20 percent of the maize crop.
