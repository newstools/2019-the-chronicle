SENSEI Vascon Dube left for Japan on Monday to take part in the 2019 Shito-Ryu Karate-Do Keiyuukai Kounotori International Friendship Open Karate Cup. Participating countries include Japan, Australia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Denmark, England, France and South Africa. Dube, a member of Shito-Ryu Karate-do Kofukan, is a national champion and will compete in both Kata (form of demonstration) and Kumite (fighting). Bulawayo Metropolitan Karate Association (BMKA) chairman Ndabezihle Mazibuko said this was something big not only for Dube, but the association too. He expressed gratitude to those that contributed financially towards Dube’s trip, particularly the Tregers Group, which purchased his return ticket to Japan. The purpose of the tournament is to provide an environment promoting fellowship and solidarity where participants can experience the joy of karate combined with international friendship exchange. The aim is to support future individual growth and further enrich karate and sporting activities and enhance the healthy development of young people. The trip also includes a tour of some of Japan’s world heritage sites. — @innocentskizoe
