The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter THE Fina Swimming coaching clinic, designed to train coaches at an intermediate level, got underway at a hotel in Bulawayo on Thursday. Fina is the international federation recognised for administering international competitions in water sports. Zimbabwe Swimming Board of Control chairperson Lorna Riley said she was pleased that the course has commenced. “So far I can’t complain, everything is going well. We have 21 participants who will be attending this course. Theory lessons will be at a local hotel, while practical lessons will be held at Christian Brothers’ College (CBC),” she said. Their online course began on July 1 and participants were schooled on coaching behaviour and philosophy, the coach’s role and responsibilities, risk management, anti-doping, session planning, lifestyle management, planning and periodisation and physiological aspects. Rick Powers, who is an international Fina lecturer and an American Swimming Coaches’ Association (ASCA) Level Five coach, has joined as the guest facilitator for this year’s coaching clinic. Powers has given more international clinics than any other swimming coach. He has tutored in 53 different countries in five continents. In 2010, Fina launched its first Swimming Coaches certification, which was met by a wave of enthusiasm with a record 200 coaches attending the first course held in Bogota, Colombia. Powers was the first Fina-appointed lecturer for this programme. The purpose of this course is for all swimming coaches around the world to be acknowledged as certified swimming coaches and to offer recognition for the work they have accomplished. The Fina coaching clinic is scheduled to end on August 26. Those that would have succeeded will acquire Fina level two coaching certificates.
