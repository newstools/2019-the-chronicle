The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA Southern Region Division One outfit Nengasha’s maiden dance in the second tier league hangs in the balance unless the Hwange-based club raises about $1 500 as part of its affiliation fees before the end of the week. The club has not been fixtured since the season got underway due to its failure to raise the minimum amount. “They intimated at raising something by the end of the week, but if they fail to raise the figure we will then be left with no option except to chuck them out and have a 15-team league,” said Mehluli Thebe, the Zifa Southern Region spokesperson. He said Bosso 90 and Moto Moto, the two other teams that were giving the league sleepless nights, had since made payment plans that were accepted by the board, but Nengasha seemed reluctant. According to Thebe, new clubs like Nengasha have to pay a total of $3 250, which include registration, and player licences as well as the technical members. Meanwhile, ambitious Talen Vision have opened a two-point lead at the top of the log standings following their hard fought 1-0 win over Bosso 90 on Friday, which was further helped by Bulawayo City’s controversial 0-0 draw away to league debutants Binga Pirates at Binga High School on Saturday. Vision and City remain the only two unbeaten teams in three games and the championship race is almost certainly going to be between the two sides. City, however, will feel hard done by the manner in which they were denied a win in Binga after their goal, which was initially given, was later ruled out, with the referee saying the ball went in through torn nets.
