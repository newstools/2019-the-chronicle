The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter BULAWAYO City midfielder Innocent Kutsanzira is set to be out of action for a lengthy spell after breaking his leg during a Zifa Southern Region Division One League game against CIWU on Friday. City won the game 3-1 to shoot back to the top of the league table. CIWU midfielder Tyson Mazithulela was red-carded for a crude open foot tackle which left Kutsanzira with a broken leg and hospitalised. With no stretcher at the venue, a table top was used to ferry Kutsanzira into an open City of Bulawayo Nissan pick-up truck, as there was no ambulance on site, which has become a norm with Division One football. Bulawayo City FC public relations officer Thandiwe Moyo said Kutsanzira is set to see a specialist. “Kutsanzira is expected to see an orthopedic surgeon anytime this week. He will be out for six months, but the surgeon will guide us,” she said. Friday’s win saw Bulawayo City returning to the top of the league table, a point ahead of second-placed Talen Vision, who were held to a goalless draw by ZPC Hwange on Saturday. It promises to be a thrilling finish to the league, with Bulawayo City and Talen Vision set to take the race to the wire. Indlovu Iyanyathela’s top four dream was kept alive following an impressive 2-0 victory over Bosso 90.
