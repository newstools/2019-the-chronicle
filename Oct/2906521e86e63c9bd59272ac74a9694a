The Chronicle Blessings Chidakwa\Victor Maphosa, Harare Bureau The Government has assigned five more contractors to undertake road works on the Beitbridge-Harare-Chirundu highway and also released $150 million for the project. Work is expected to start soon. The five companies contracted are Tensor Systems, Masimba Construction, Fossil Contractors, Exodus Company and Bitumen World and have been allocated 20km stretches each, with room for expansion to 100km depending on their performance. The highway is key in attaining Vision 2030, which seeks to turn the country into an upper middle income economy. This was said by Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza in Norton on Thursday while assessing progress on a road-over-rail bridge along a section of the Harare-Bulawayo Highway. “There is a lot of progress going on, we recently finished the selection process of the five contractors and the contracts have been signed,” he said. “Next week the companies will start moving to their respective sites. That has been our plea that the project gets the necessary attention it deserves.  Treasury has also availed $150 million for the five companies to use for mobilisation of resources and getting on their respective sites. Treasury will also be doing monthly disbursements.”
