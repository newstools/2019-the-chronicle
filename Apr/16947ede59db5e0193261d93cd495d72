Mountain Climbers Football Academy vice- chairman Takudzwa Mashayahanya saidthe gala is open to all social teams and individuals willing to take part in a collective event that will see players from selected sporting disciplines meet at one place. “We are going to hold a sport gala with different sporting disciplines such as soccer, pool, darts and netball from April 18-22. This is a form of socialising during the Easter holiday. Sporting events will be starting at 10AM up to 5PM then after that there is entertainment throughout the night. “The objective is to bring people together and give them a platform to interact and share sporting skills,” said Mashayahanya. “Sports should be widely promoted in a bid to curb the inclination of youths towards negative and unhealthy activities associated with the use of drugs. Sporting initiatives in the form of galas must be declared mandatory for academies, colleges and universities to have ample sports facilities for their students. As a result, we saw it fit to cater for social teams by giving them a chance to have some form of interaction,” he said. — @DecoDecent2
