The Chronicle Ronald Mashinga, Sports Reporter RAPTORS won the Spar Bonsa T20 League title after beating Badgers by five wickets at the Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy on Sunday. Badger’s batsmen had appeared comfortable in the first 10 overs, scoring 66 runs for the loss of two wickets. Badgers captain Thamsanqa Nunu fell victim to all-rounder Simba Haukodzi’s bowling for 27 runs. Haukodzi then followed up with another wicket, trapping Godwin Chimuto in front for seven in the 12th over. Chris Mpofu went for two, leaving Badgers on 79/4 in the 14th over. Badgers then collapsed, scoring just 20 runs and losing six wickets in the last six overs of the innings to reach a total of 99 all out. With Raptors needing 100 runs to clinch the title, Badgers’ attack applied early pressure and struck through Mpofu, who took out national team player Dalubuhle Mboyi for seven runs. Kevin Kasuza followed suit, falling to Sheunopa Musekwa, leaving his side on 28/2 after three overs. Mandisi Moyo found same gaps and struck some boundaries for an impressive 47 runs before being removed by Donald Tapfuma. Raptors captain Flemming Nkomo sealed the deal with two boundaries. “We have had a fantastic six weeks of cricket and we hope everyone enjoyed it. We have done this tournament for Zimbabwe Cricket and the players. I would like to thank the corporates that came on board to assist us in making this tournament exciting and bigger than it was last year,” said tournament director Kalpesh Parshotom. Last year’s champions Blazers finished third after beating the Hawks by three runs.
