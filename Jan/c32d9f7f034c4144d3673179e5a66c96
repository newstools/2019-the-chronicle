A GWANDA man has been arrested for ganging up with his accomplices, who are still at large, and damaged property at the Zanu- PF Matabeleland South provincial offices during last week’s violence and looting spree instigated by the opposition. Kukhanyakwenkosi Mkandla (34) of St Christopher Flats in Gwanda was not asked to plead when he appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Mrs Nomagugu Sibanda facing charges of public violence and malicious damage. Mkandla’s lawyer, Mr Melusi Dube of Dube, Mguni and Dube Legal Practitioners made an application before the court for his client to be remanded out of custody on his own cognisance. In his application Mr Dube said his client was not a flight risk and did not have a criminal record. More to follow. . .
