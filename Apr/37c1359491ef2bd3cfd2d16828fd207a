The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter RENOWNED sports administrator Titus Zvomuya and respected legal fundi Gerald Mlotshwa are odds-on favourites to land the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) chairmanship post that was left vacant following dissolution of the board led by Edwards Siwela. The Siwela-led board was dissolved in October last year by Youth, Sport, Art and Recreation Minister Kirsty Coventry. According to sources, Coventry has identified seven individuals for appointment to the new SRC board. “From the names that we have gleaned, Zvomuya and Mlotshwa are odds on favourites to be appointed chairman or vice-chairman of the Commission. The names are now waiting for approval by President Mnangagwa,” said the source. Besides Zvomuya and Mlotshwa, other names earmarked for the new board include Nigel Munyati, Collen de Jong, Karen Mutasa, who leads the Harare Central Business District Development Association (HCBDDA), Allen Chiura and Victoria Falls-based tour operator, Gail Van Jaarsvelt. According to the SRC Act, the board shall consist of – (a) a chairman and not fewer than five and not more than nine other members appointed by the Minister after consultation with the President and subject to such directions as the President may give him or her; and (b)the director-general, who shall be an ex-officio member of the board. “Members referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) shall be appointed for their ability and experience in sport or administration or both or for their suitability otherwise for appointment. The members of the board shall elect a vice-chairman of the board from among themselves, and the vice-chairman shall exercise the functions of the chairman during any period that the chairman is unable to exercise his functions,” reads part of section five of the SRC Act. The appointed board members shall hold office for a period not exceeding three years.
