The Chronicle Harare Bureau MINISTER of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Kirsty Coventry yesterday said Government will leave no stone unturned in their preparations for the Africa Games after appointing seasoned administrator Eugenia Chidhakwa to be the chef de-mission for Team Zimbabwe. Chidhakwa, who is a director in the Ministry of Sport, will be assisted by Martin Dururu from the Sports Commission on the technical side and Memory Pakati from the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee from the administrative side. The Games will take place this August in Morocco with more than 5 000 professional and amateur athletes competing in 27 sport codes.
