The Chronicle Mehluli Sibanda in Gaborone, Botswana LOVEMORE Munyamana added to his long list of bodybuilding achievements by winning the senior men’s title at the Designer Physique in Gaborone, Botswana on Saturday night. The 35-year-old bodybuilder from Body Works Gym in Bulawayo had promised fireworks prior to the show and that’s exactly what he delivered as he swept yet another title. <img class=" wp-image-448237" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-left-and-Delvin-Page-right-side-chest-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="790" height="441" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-left-and-Delvin-Page-right-side-chest-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-left-and-Delvin-Page-right-side-chest.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /> Lovemore Munyamana (left) and Delvin Page (right) side chest He was at his usual best with a symmetrical body and it came as no surprise when the seven-time Mr Bulawayo was adjudged the best senior man on display in a line-up that had nine contestants. Munyamana took home P2 000, a gold medal and supplements. Second place went to Delvin Page, also from Body Works Gym. A delighted Munyamana said he had a feeling that he was going to walk away with the top prize because of the hard work he had put into his preparations. <img class=" wp-image-448238" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-middle-and-Delvin-Page-right-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="783" height="437" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-middle-and-Delvin-Page-right-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-middle-and-Delvin-Page-right.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 783px) 100vw, 783px" /> Lovemore Munyamana (middle) and Delvin Page (right) His conquest at the Designer Physique came exactly a week after he won the senior men’s under 75kgs division at the PPC Zimbabwe International Trade Fair Open Bodybuilding and Fitness Championship where he was beaten to the overall title by South Africa-based Ndumiso Dlodlo. “I feel happy being the champion, it makes me work harder. I thank all the athletes, they were good, but I managed to beat them. I had the feeling when I came here that I will be number one because I worked hard for this competition,” Munyamana said. <img class=" wp-image-448241" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-double-bicep-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="776" height="433" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-double-bicep-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-double-bicep.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 776px) 100vw, 776px" /> Lovemore Munyamana double bicep For 26-year-old Page, it was a massive improvement for him from the sixth place finish at the PPC ZITF show. <img class=" wp-image-448242" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-with-part-of-his-prize-for-winning-Designer-Physique-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="774" height="432" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-with-part-of-his-prize-for-winning-Designer-Physique-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Lovemore-Munyamana-with-part-of-his-prize-for-winning-Designer-Physique.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /> Lovemore Munyamana with part of his prize for winning Designer Physique Munyamana paid tribute to Page, whom he felt was good on the night, but needs to pay attention to his legs and chest. “Delvin was good, his back was awesome; I said to him he must work hard on his legs and chest.” <img class=" wp-image-448244" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Kyle-MacDonald-with-her-women-bikini-fitness-prizes-360x212.jpg" alt="" width="774" height="456" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Kyle-MacDonald-with-her-women-bikini-fitness-prizes-360x212.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Kyle-MacDonald-with-her-women-bikini-fitness-prizes.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /> Kyle MacDonald with her women bikini fitness prizes Kylie MacDonald continued to shine in the sport when she won the women’s bikini fitness in what was only her fourth show. <img class=" wp-image-448246" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Zibusiso-Khumalo-junior-men-Under-23-champion-at-Designer-Physique-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="774" height="432" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Zibusiso-Khumalo-junior-men-Under-23-champion-at-Designer-Physique-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Zibusiso-Khumalo-junior-men-Under-23-champion-at-Designer-Physique.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px" /> Zibusiso Khumalo junior men Under-23 champion at Designer Physique Prechard “Carter” Hoko was the first runner-up in the men’s physique, which was won by Ithueng Siresi of Botswana. Zibusiso Khumalo also from Bulawayo won the junior men’s Under-23. It was certainly a great outing for the five bodybuilders from Bulawayo, as they all managed to achieve a top two finish. MacDonald was forced to withdraw from the women’s beach bikini as the judges felt she was too tough for that category. <img class=" wp-image-448248" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Prechard-Hoko-getting-his-mens-physque-first-runner-up-prize-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="770" height="430" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Prechard-Hoko-getting-his-mens-physque-first-runner-up-prize-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/Prechard-Hoko-getting-his-mens-physque-first-runner-up-prize.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px" /> Prechard Hoko getting his men’s physque first runner up prize For Body Works Gym director Nathan Greenland, who personally drove his bodybuilders from Bulawayo to Gaborone, it must have been a proud moment to see them finishing in the top two in their sections having also been at their best at the PPC ZITF event. Next up for the Body Works Gym athletes is the Muscle and Fitness Open Classic to be held in Gweru on May 25. — @Mdawini_29
