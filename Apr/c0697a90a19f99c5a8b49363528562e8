The Chronicle Ellina Mhlanga, Harare Bureau ZIMBABWE Netball Association president, Leticia Chipandu, says they are on course with their preparations for the Gems’ maiden appearance at the World Cup in Liverpool, England, from July 12 to 21. The team have been in camp for the past two weeks in Harare under the guidance of coach Lloyd Makunde. The national association have arranged some friendlies before the Gems leave for the global showcase. “The team is in camp, the wheel is in motion. The Ministry has already paid 40 percent to the oganising committee. ”Our total budget is plus or minus US$100 000. If the Government has paid 40 percent why should it be in doubt? “There are so many people who are very enthusiastic, there are so many groups that are fund-raising. ”People are fund-raising, the government is also doing its portion, so we are on course. We are preparing a long list of players that we are supposed to submit. “We are supposed to submit a long list of 20 players by mid-month. We were given deadlines by which we are supposed to have applied for visas,” Chipandu said. The national association hosted a golf day last month as part of their fund-raising efforts. Zimbabwe are one of the four African countries that will be competing at the 16-team event. South Africa, Uganda and Malawi will also be taking part. Zimbabwe are up against Australia, Northern Ireland and Sri Lanka in Group A. The Gems are expected to leave for Liverpool on July 7.
