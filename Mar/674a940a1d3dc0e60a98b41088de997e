The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent Radio personality and comedian Babongile Sikhonjwa feels honoured to be nominated in the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) Outstanding Radio Journalist category. During his two-year stint at Skyz Metro FM that ended abruptly last month, Sikhonjwa who presented the Vuka Vuka breakfast show was credited by Bulawayo artistes for giving them a break in the industry. Apart from being honoured, Sikhonjwa who is up against Star FMs Mai Judah and ZiFM Stereo’s duo of Patience Musa and Sekuru Nhire said the Nama nomination showed that he was doing something right in the arts industry. “To be nominated from Bulawayo is a huge achievement as an artiste. Also, it speaks volumes for a regional station such as Skyz Metro FM as it is being recognised nationally. “It’ll be nice if I could bring the award home,” said Sikhonjwa who is now focusing on his growing entertainment business. He said it was a feather in his cap to be among the best radio personalities in the land with the likes of Mai Judah and Musa who present shows on national radio stations. He commended the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) for recognising the contribution by radio presenters from regional radio stations. “This recognition shows that smaller radio stations in the country can get recognition and everything is based on merit. Good work is good work. I respect NACZ for picking smaller radio station DJs. “When you’re at these (regional stations), you have to work five times as hard as your national counterparts to get recognition,” said Sikhonjwa. Last year, Sikhonjwa was not nominated but he had a special mention for his contribution to the arts industry. “Last time I wasn’t nominated, they just said they noticed my contribution to the arts industry. It was great at that time and now that I’ve been nominated, it shows that I’m consistent. “It also shows growth in my career,” he said.
