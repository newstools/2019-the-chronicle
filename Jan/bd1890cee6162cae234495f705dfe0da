THE Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) is moving remand prisoners to bigger prisons in an effort to minimise overcrowding at smaller prisons. ZPCS public relations officer Chief Correctional Officer Meya Khanyezi said it was important to manage overcrowding at prisons as it has a negative impact on the rehabilitation of prisoners. “The issue of overcrowding in prisons is problematic as it stretches limited resources. ZPCS always endeavours to minimise overcrowding by ensuring that some offenders awaiting trial are accommodated at other less overcrowded prisons within a particular area. With reference to Bulawayo, some remand prisoners are being accommodated at Prisons at Khami Complex,” said Chief Correctional Officer Khanyezi. She said the purpose of imprisonment in modern times hinges on rehabilitation rather than retribution. “To this end, overcrowding in prisons impacts negatively on resources that are supposed to be channelled towards rehabilitation, which include learning material as well as equipment used in skills development,” she said. Chief Correctional Officer Khanyezi said ZPCS currently has adequate food to feed 17 000 inmates held at different prisons. “Currently the food situation in our prisons is stable with inmates being given three meals a day. In cases of shortages, further requests will be made for the provision of more rations in order to ensure that offenders are adequately fed. “We have slightly over 17 000 inmates against a holding capacity of 17 000,” said Chief Correctional Officer Khanyezi. Two weeks ago, prisons recorded a sharp increase in the number of inmates, especially in Bulawayo, where more than 600 people were arrested in connection with violent demonstrations and looting that took place at business centres in high density areas. Last year, the ZPCS released more than 3 000 inmates on a clemency order by President Mnangagwa. — @pamelashumba1
