BULAWAYO-born jazz musician, Dereck Mpofu, who rose to fame after the release of Chisikana Changu Zimbabwe, is set to launch a new album titled Godobori 2.0 next month. The launch on March 22 has been slated for Theatre in the Park at Harare Gardens. Produced by Mono Mukundu, the album features Ghanaian musician Wiyaala, up-and-coming musician Rachel J and comedian-cum-songstress, Mai TT. The Goodwill Environmental Ambassador, who is also behind the Dzoka Kumba track that features Cynthia Mare, said Godobori 2.0 consists of a lot of love songs which he hopes many people will like. “I hope people will enjoy this album as much as I enjoyed working on it. It was such a pleasure working with a renowned producer on this project,” he said. “This album has great collaborations. There’s a duet I did with Mai TT in Ndebele as well as a love ballad with songstress Rachel J which are tracks people should look out for.” Godobori 2.0, Mpofu said, is a sequel to his fourth studio album, Godobori, which he released in 2017 and recorded a DVD. Through his Chisikana Changu Zimbabwe, Mpofu was appointed as the goodwill environmental ambassador for Zimbabwe in 2012 under the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate and City of Harare. The singer has worked with several artistes locally and outside including Winnie Khumalo, Teddy Bears, Alexio Kawara, Willis Wataffi and Ras Caleb.
