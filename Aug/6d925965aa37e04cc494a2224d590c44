The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter A 19-YEAR-OLD man from Bulawayo has been sentenced to perform 840 hours of community service for stabbing his ex-girlfriend’s lover. Victor Nyoni stabbed Mr Shepherd Jele (22) on the chest several times with a knife over allegations that he was sleeping with Ms Melinda Ngoma. Nyoni pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate, Mr Mafios Moyo. The magistrate convicted and sentenced him to 840 hours of community service. Prosecuting, Mr Thobekani Nyathi said on May 22 at around 1AM, Mr Jele came out of a bedroom from where he had been sleeping with Ms Ngoma. “The complainant had left his friend, Mr Thubalami Ngwebu, waiting for him outside the house so that they leave the area together as it was at night. “As Mr Jele made his way out of the room, the accused person suddenly appeared and grabbed him by the neck before stabbing him several times on the chest,” he said. Mr Ngwebu, the prosecutor said, ran to try and save his friend by pulling Nyoni away before the accused person fled the scene. Mr Nyathi said Mr Ngwebu assisted his friend and the two walked to a nearby house where they got transport to take the complainant to the United Bulawayo Hospitals where he received treatment. He was discharged from hospital a week later. A report was made to the police leading to Nyoni’s arrest. — @zinyuke98
