The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo who stole goats worth $1 800 was lucky to escape jail when he was sentenced to community service. Nkosiyapha Ndlovu (33) from Kensington suburb stole 10 goats from Mr Khesiwe Nsikane (73) from Queenspark East suburb. Ndlovu was convicted on his own plea of guilty to one count of stock theft by Bulawayo magistrate Ms Ulukile Muleya. “After considering evidence that has been brought before the court, you are found guilty as charged. “You are therefore sentenced to do community service under government and you will not be getting paid,” ruled the magistrate. Ndlovu was ordered to perform 510 hours of community service at Hillside Police station. In his defence, he said: “I admit that I stole 10 goats but I wanted to take care of my deceased sister’s children and my family. I have four children to take care of.” Prosecuting, Mr Nathan Marime said on May 28 at Willsgroove, Ndlovu stole 10 goats that were grazing and went to hide them at his home. He said Mr Nsikane went to look for his goats at around 6PM and he did not find them. Mr Marime said Mr Nsikane’s son, Mehluli, got a tip off from local residents that there were goats tied to a tree at Kensington and went to search Ndlovu’s place. He said Mehluli found nine goats. One goat had already been slaughtered. The value of stolen goats was $1 800 and goats worth $1 500 were recovered.—@sharonbuwe
