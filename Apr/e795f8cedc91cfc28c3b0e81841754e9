The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter TWENTY-EIGHT runners will compete in the 60th edition of the ZITF Four-Minute Mile semi-finals to be held on Friday at Bulawayo’s ceremonial home of athletics, White City Stadium. The pair of Sparrows Athletics Club’s Thando Maphosa and Willard Mutasa of Bulawayo Jumbos was the last to book a place in the semi-finals after qualifying at the Independence Day race held at White City Stadium last Thursday. All runners failed to make the grade at the final qualifying race for the ZITF meet sponsored by Delta beverages held in Mutare in the second leg of the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe’s JM Busha Track and Field event. The qualifying time for the ZITF Delta Beverages Four-Minute Mile race is four minutes 31 seconds. The 28 athletes will compete in the semi-final on Friday with 20 athletes that post the best times going through to the final set for the ZITF Main Arena on Saturday. Among top runners that have qualified for the race are defending champion Wellington Varevi of Black Rhinos, his clubmate Tendai Zimuto and the ZRP trio of Blessmore Chidziva, Isaac Mpofu and Trust Chidomaya. Tendai Hove of Black Rhinos, Zimbabwe Prison and Correctional Services’ Nomore Wikiri and local athlete Dumo Mkhwananzi of Sparrows Athletics Club also made the cut. “The stage is set for the last part of the race and we have two guys that managed to qualify at the final qualifying races on Independence Day at White City Stadium in Bulawayo. We didn’t get any athlete in Mutare, meaning we will have a strong field of 28 competing in the semi-finals, with 20 going through to the final,” said Bulawayo Athletics Board chairman Manuel Mpofu. Organisers of the competition have maintained last year’s prizes, with the winner set to get $800, $400 for the second-placed athlete and $300 for the athlete that finishes third.
