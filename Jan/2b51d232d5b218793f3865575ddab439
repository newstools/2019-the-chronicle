VICTORIA Falls soccer lovers had an action packed weekend when Herentals Group of Colleges organised a seven-team pre-season tournament. Seven community clubs — FC Airport, CAAZ, Kazungula United, Mbabazane, Mashizha, Mosi Tigers and Sinathankawu squared off at Moringa Grounds before hundreds of spectators. FC Airport emerged victors after seeing off Kazungula United 1-0 in the final. Victoria Falls Social Soccer League organised the tournament in conjunction with Herentals Victoria Falls campus who were the sponsors. Herentals Victoria Falls branch principal Sidney Yangu said the tournament was part of the institution’s social responsibility programme meant to thank the community for supporting the college. “This is the first time that we have done this in Victoria Falls as we try to get into the community and familiarise with our main stakeholder who is the parent. We opened our doors to Victoria Falls last year and we organised this to thank parents for their support and also to make ourselves visible. “We are so excited about the turnout and we hope to make this bigger. The tournament was made possible by our director Innocent Benza who availed funds,” said Yangu. He said the tournament will be an annual event and urged parents to enrol their children with the institution. Yangu said enrolment for 2019 has been slow and hoped interacting with parents through a soccer tournament would endear the college to parents.
Similar tournaments were held countrywide. Vic Falls Social Soccer League representative Tonderai Mutasa said participants were drawn from the top eight teams from the 2018 season. “This was a successful tournament with high rate of discipline. We are grateful to the sponsors, they wanted the tournament to coincide with our pre season and we are happy to learn it’s going to be an annual event,” said Mutasa. Herentals Group of Colleges boasts of 45 centres countrywide. — ncubeleon
