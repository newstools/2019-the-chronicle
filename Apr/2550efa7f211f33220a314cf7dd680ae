The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter SOUTHERN Region Division One League title favourites Bulawayo City received two sets of playing kit from the United kingdom ahead of their second league match against Mosi Rovers. The kit was donated to the club by UK-based Onele Gumbo who grew up in Pumula suburb. The red and white Puma branded kit, similar to the Arsenal and Stoke City outfits, was unveiled during the team’s training at St Columbas High School grounds.
“We are grateful to a Bulawayo resident based in the UK who sourced two quality playing kits for us and promised to deliver a third set so on. “This is a welcome gesture from a member of the society who values and supports brand Bulawayo City. This means that we’ll use the old kit as a training kit and give the other uniforms to our juniors. Hopefully, donning new jerseys will motivate the boys this season so that we quickly return to the Premiership,” said City chairman Jerry Sibanda.
City, who retained the bulk of the squad that got them relegated from the topflight league, kicked off their Division One campaign in style, clobbering Arenel Movers 5-0. The municipal club will play against Mosi Rovers at Luveve Stadium on Saturday hoping to take their points’ tally to six. Mosi Rovers were inactive last weekend. The Southern Region Division One League Easter holidays programme starts today in Hwange where Makomo, still smarting from a 3-1 loss to Talen Vision, play against another championship favourite ZPC Hwange at Mpumalanga grounds.
