A 24-YEAR-OLD man has appeared in court for assaulting his drinking partner after he restrained him from fighting another man. Nkosana Mpofu appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mrs Adelaide Mbeure who remanded him in custody to tomorrow for sentence. He pleaded guilty to an assault charge. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said the assault happened last December in a bar at Dundubala Business Centre in Insuza. Mr Bhekimpilo Ncube (24) who resides at Dundubala village was assaulted by Mpofu after he tried to stop him from fighting another man he had been exchanging words with. “On December 24 last year at around 10PM, Mpofu and Mr Ncube were drinking beer at Dundubala business centre. A misunderstanding arose between Mpofu and their other drinking mate leading to them exchanging words,” said Mr Mageza. “The two started fighting each other then Mr Ncube intervened restraining the two from fighting. “Mpofu picked a brick and hit Ncube once on his forehead,” he said. The court heard Ncube sustained a cut on his forehead and was referred to hospital for medical examination. The medical report was produced in court as an exhibit. — @gwizi_n.
