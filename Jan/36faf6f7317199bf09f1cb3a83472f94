THE Bulawayo Athletics Club (BAC) cricket team have begun training with a number of new players that make up the 40-member squad. Club chairman Gary Nyumbu said: “We’ve started our training after a long rest and we hope to perform well when the matches resume. There’s a lot of excitement just like one’s first day at school. The squad is geared up for the games to start.” He said the training is meant to slowly build fitness levels and match practice. “By the time we resume playing, we should have played quite a number of friendlies. Lack of facilities and equipment is always a setback, meaning that this aspect of focusing on training must be completed on a personal level,” said Nyumbu. He said their training programme will be geared in part towards ensuring the players are in the right shape to avoid injury when the season starts. “Avoiding injury is also a big priority if the players are to develop as a team and as a unit and we’re assisting them in ensuring that when the season starts the players are match-fit and injury free,” he said. BAC captain Flemming Nkomo is optimistic his team has what it takes to finish among the top two. “We believe the club dealt well in the transfer market since our average team age is 22. The squad has been beefed up with the addition of Sakhumuzi Ndlela, an all-rounder from Falcon (College),” Nkomo said. In addition, the squad also brought in Brandon James, an all-rounder from CBC, and batsman Thamsanqa Nunu. “It will be hard for the coach to choose from a strong squad and it is good for the team as it will promote competitiveness and help us going forward,” said Nkomo. — @DecoDecent2
