HIGHLANDERS risk the embarrassment of losing points on a 3-0 walkover scoreline if they don’t pay renewal fees before the weekend for their Bosso 90 franchise that plays in the Zifa Southern Region Division One. Bosso 90 owe the Southern Region over $5 000 since they also did not pay their dues last season and, according to spokesperson of Zifa Southern Region, Mehluli Thebe, all teams that haven’t paid affiliation or made any tangible payment arrangements with the league will not be fixtured this weekend when the Division One season gets underway. “It will be a walk over for those teams that haven’t paid up. As it stands, all but six teams have paid and we expect to have three of those six paying today (yesterday), as we have received commitment from them,” said Thebe. Moto Moto, Toronto and CIWU are expected to regularise their membership today.
