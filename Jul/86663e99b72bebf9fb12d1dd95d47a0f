The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Binga THE Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) yesterday handed houses to some of its members in Binga under the force’s housing Benefit Fund that has seen the armed forces becoming home owners countrywide. Started in 1988, the ZDF Benefit Fund seeks to ensure that the armed forces live a decent life through provision of housing in line with United Nations’ driven mandate for provision of accommodation to all citizens. The ZDF is carrying out the project countrywide. It acquires land from respective local authorities and build houses using monthly membership contributions. Yesterday ZDF Benefit Fund vice chairperson Air Commodore Brian John Chikonzo handed over 20 houses to beneficiaries drawn from the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ). Sixty members have so far benefited in Binga. The remaining 40 houses are still under construction. Two weeks ago 20 houses were handed over to beneficiaries in Plumtree where 130 houses are still under construction. Speaking at the handover ceremony in Binga, Air Commodore Chikonzo said the housing project was one of the many ZDF initiatives meant to improve its members’ livelihoods. “Today we are gathered here in Binga to witness yet another great occasion in which 20 housing units are being handed over to beneficiaries. Forty were handed over previously and the ZDF Benefit Fund still has a task to complete the remaining 40 house to bring to 100 houses in Binga,” he said. Air Commodore Chikonzo said the project is also meant to instil positivity among members of the ZDF. “The construction of these houses is meant to spur development in Binga and other areas. The fund has  since inception in 1988, built hundreds of houses in different cities and towns. Lieutenant Colonel Farai Brian Rwizi who is in charge of loans and projects within ZDF, said similar projects are underway in different parts of the country. — @ncubeleon
