The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE Zifa Central Region Division One League kicked off at the weekend with newcomers Filabusi United playing a goalless draw away to Kwekwe United, while Maphisa-based The Venue started succumbed 0-1 to Shabanie Mine at Maglas Stadium. Kwekwe United were awarded a penalty in the second half, but failed to convert and that proved to be a waste for the Blues, who couldn’t utilise home advantage. Despite losing their first match in the First Division after getting promoted as Zifa Matabeleland South Pool B champions of 2018, The Venue president Bokani Ndlovu said the club had learnt a lot from an experienced side and is proud of his boys’ performance. “I’m not disappointed because losing by one goal against one of the favourites in the league is a sign we’re on the right track. Shabanie is an experienced side and we were not expecting to play that well. Like a newcomer at school, it is normal for players to get nervous considering it’s their first match in a different league,” said Ndlovu. “Most of our away matches are far and it’s no secret that it’s going to affect us because we’ll travel as far as Beitbridge, Gokwe and Kwekwe. We’ll do our best and we’re still appealing to the business world to come to our rescue because we’re already feeling the pinch.” Ndlovu believes the club has what it takes to take Premiership football to Matobo District, but said they will need financial support. He said The Venue was expecting Zifa to assess the grounds at Minda High School which they’re looking to use and believes they can meet the required standards.
