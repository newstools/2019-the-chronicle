ZPC Kariba have reshuffled their management with club spokesperson Fadzai Chisveto taking over the reins as the new chairperson. Chisveto, who also retained her position as the club’s spokesperson, replaced embattled Tungamirai Mazarire who had been involved in a long battle with stakeholders and supporters. The club’s supporters have been calling for the removal of the executive for some time now. The club’s board have responded by naming Chisveto as the new chairperson while retaining secretary-general Robert Mamvura and treasurer Gwinyai Dzorani. “We have made some few changes to the club executive as required by the constitution that we should appoint or re-appoint the executive after every three years. “Our current spokesperson, Fadzai Chisveto, has been appointed the new executive chairperson of ZPC Kariba. ”Mr Mamvura has been re-appointed the secretary-general and Mr Dzorani has also been re-appointed as the treasurer of the club,” said a club official. Chisveto was not keen to discuss the developments. ”We have made some changes in our club executive. The chairman’s contract was not renewed as he has some pressing company commitments and we have retained some members from the last executive to help in building our club. “We would want to assure our stakeholders and supporters that we will be holding elections for the remaining posts in the coming weeks and surely before the season begins. “We would want to urge supporters to give us and, most importantly, the coach (Godfrey Tamirepi) another opportunity to prove himself in the forthcoming season,” said Chisveto. Our harare Bureau also understands that club board chairman Robson Chikuri has resigned to focus on company commitments and has been replaced by Kenneth Maswera.
