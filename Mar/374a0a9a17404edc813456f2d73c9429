The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter Tribal house group Djembe Monks which recently launched their Bantu Migrant album, wowed patrons when they performed it at the Vintage Shisha Bar on Friday night. The group that took to the stage at 10PM played to a full house. They performed all the 13 tracks on the album including fan favourites Somabhula which features Willis Wataffi and Njelimana ft Martyn Oosthuizen. Fans were mostly thrilled by the live Djembe drums and requested for the drummer to play solo and show his drumming prowess. Commenting after the show, the group’s drummer Emmanuel ‘Rootz’ Nkomo said: “It was great seeing people sing along to the songs on the album as it shows that they’re are listening and loving it.” He said the show at Vintage Shisha Bar was to promote the new album with plans to perform it at different venues in the country. “We want to make sure that this album reaches many ears. From the beginning of this year, we’ve been playing regularly in Harare and Victoria Falls at corporate and public events, something we’ll continue doing throughout the year. “We’re grateful to those who’re buying our music online as we’ve had great digital and physical sales.” The group that has never recorded a music video said when the right time comes they will work on one as they do not want to rush it.
