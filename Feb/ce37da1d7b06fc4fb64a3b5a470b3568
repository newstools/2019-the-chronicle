THE deputy president of the Chiefs Council, Chief Mtshane, has said the 2018/19 farming season is a gloomy one for most communal farmers as some have failed to plant due to erratic rains. This is a result of El-Nino weather conditions which were predicted for the 2018/19 rainy season. The El-Nino induced weather condition has resulted in most of the country receiving normal to below normal rainfalls while temperatures are mostly high. In an interview on the crop situation yesterday, Chief Mtshane said the 2018/19 rainy season was catastrophic for most communal farmers. “This season is a difficult one for most of the people. Crops are in serious distress and if we do not get significant rains this week, a lot of our people will not get anything from their fields. I foresee a serious drought situation in most parts of the country,” said Chief Mtshane. He said even livestock farmers were not spared by the impact of El-Nino induced weather conditions. —@nqotshili
