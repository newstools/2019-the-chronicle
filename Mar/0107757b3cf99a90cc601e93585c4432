The Chronicle Michael Magoronga, Midlands Correspondent A POPULAR Kwekwe gold dealer died on the spot after about 15 people attacked him and a colleague with machetes and knives before running over his body with a vehicle. Tinovimba Mahachi of T78 Torwood, Redcliff died on the spot while his colleague Shadreck Shosherai (36) is battling for life at Kwekwe General Hospital following the attack in the wee hours of last Saturday morning outside Yoyo Night Club. The matter came to light when two of the accused, Daniel Tembo (24) and Brian Maseko (23), appeared before Kwekwe Magistrate Mr Storey Rushambwa on Tuesday facing murder charges. The duo was remanded in custody to April 2 and was advised to apply for bail at the High Court. The State led by Mrs Ethel Bhumure alleged that on March 16 around 1 AM, Mahachi and Shosherai were sleeping in a Toyota Mark X outside Yoyo Night Club when the gang pounced. “A group of about 15 people approached the vehicle armed with iron bars, knives and machetes. They force opened the vehicle’s doors and began assaulting the occupants without saying anything,” read the court papers. One of the accused persons, the court heard, opened the passenger door and stabbed Mahachi once in the chest using an okapi knife. As Mahachi staggered out of the car, the other assailants who were standing guard hacked him with machetes and knives and he fell on the road. Shosherai, who was sleeping in the driver seat, managed to escape with minor injuries and made a police report. While Mahachi was still lying in a pool of blood, the court heard, the accused persons went on to assault him with iron bars, machetes and kicked him savagely. One of the accused persons got into a vehicle and ran over Mahachi. His body was ferried to Kwekwe General Hospital where it awaits a post-mortem. A motive for the vicious attack has not been established.
