The Chronicle THERE was another two-day finish in the Logan Cup match at Old Hararians Sports Club on Monday, when brilliant batting by Tinashe Kamunhukamwe and Regis Chakabva enabled Eagles to chase down a testing target for the loss of three. Eagles began the day at 144 for three wickets in reply to Tuskers’ first innings of 154, but their plans to build up a big lead on the first innings were soon shattered. The pitch was very difficult, with many deliveries keeping abnormally low or even rolling, and they lost their last seven wickets for only 26 runs. Their top scorer of the first day, Richmond Mutumbami, was 66 not out overnight, but was the first to fall, run out for 70 as he called for a single. Elton Chigumbura was unfortunate to fall first ball, one from Chris Mpofu that flew sharply and unexpectedly from the pitch, struck him on the glove and rebounded into the gully. The other overnight batsman, Tino Mutombodzi, added only a single to his 20 before the low bounce saw him dismissed lbw to Thabo Mboyi, followed quickly by Luke Jongwe to Mpofu without scoring, the score then being only one run ahead of Tuskers at 155 for seven. Tony Munyonga, the promising young all-rounder, fought it out bravely from number seven to finish with six not out off 37 balls, but apart from two blows for six and four that made up Trevor Garwe’s scoring shots none of the later batsmen scored more than a single as Mpofu cleaned them up. Scores Tuskers: 154 and 149 all out in 48.1 overs (Brian Chari 54, Taffy Mupariwa 18, John Nyumbu 15; Tapiwa Mufudza 4/29, Tony Munyonga 2/26, Richard Ngarava 2/27, Trevor Garwe 2/32) Eagles: 170 and 136-3 in 15.5 overs (Tinashe Kamunhukamwe 57, Regis Chakabva 47, Richmond Mutumbami 10*; Chris Mpofu 1/23, John Nyumbu 1/27, Ernest Masuku 1/36) Eagles won by seven wickets — zimcricket
