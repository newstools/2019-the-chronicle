The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter A United Kingdom based financial services company Express Links International gave a major financial boost to the Zimbabwe Gems by giving each player 200 Pounds ahead of the Barbados World Cup match on Tuesday night which saw the girls posting a 66-41 victory. The gesture was necessitated by the company’s chief executive officer Peter Pembere. Sports and Recreation Commission board member Titus Zvomuya hailed Pembere and his company for the kind gesture. “Thank you so much Mr Peter Pembere for leading by example,” Zvomuya wrote on his Facebook timeline.
