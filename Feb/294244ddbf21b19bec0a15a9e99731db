DSTV is looking for couples to feature on the Zimbabwean edition of Our Perfect Wedding that will be broadcast on Zambezi Magic (DStv channel 160) later this year. After having called for bids for a local production team and presenter last month, DStv is now calling on couples who are interested to have their weddings featured on the reality television show to send in their applications. Liz Dziva, MultiChoice Zimbabwe publicity and public relations manager said the applications for Our Perfect Wedding Zimbabwe (OPWZw) must be sent by March 31 this year. “This show will be great fun and we hope everyone planning to wed in the next few months will apply. All they have to do to be considered is to register their application online at www.zambezimagic.com,” she said. On the show, viewers will have an opportunity to watch a behind the scenes of the couples’ weddings. The goal is for the couples to try and tick off every item on their wish list and hopefully, have their perfect wedding. They are captured checking every item on their wish list and at the end of the show declare if they had their perfect wedding. Dziva said the OPWZw show was part of efforts to increase Zimbabwean content on the Zambezi Magic channel. “Our Perfect Wedding Zimbabwe is to be broadcast on DStv’s Zambezi Magic channel as part of the ongoing drive to increase the level of Zimbabwean content on this platform. “Zambezi Magic was created to do just this and here is an excellent platform for Zimbabweans to showcase their stories about their journeys to the altar.” South African and Zambian versions of Our Perfect Wedding have so far been warmly received by DStv audiences across Africa and it is hoped that the Zimbabwean version will be equally successful.
