The Chronicle Response to “Winter wheat planting season gets underway” The Government should fully support wheat farming so that it will save foreign currency on wheat imports. – @Dabu. Facebook Response “Zanu-PF in historic Bulawayo poll win” After realising that the opposition members have been dining with the West to inflict more pain on ordinary Zimbabweans I wonder what type of people would continue supporting these guys. Its game over as we now know the main source of our problem. – Eliah. Website Response  to “An Arab Prince’s gift to ED” For those who don’t understand basic facts. Zimbabwe did not choose isolationism. The West isolated it when the country took its land back. The West then imposed sanctions on it. These sanctions mean Zimbabwe can’t do business with most countries freely. But some people amazingly think sanctions on Zimbabwe are fictitious and have no bearing to anything. So sad that educated people would be so fickle to not be able to read the simple handwriting on the wall. – Shanna6785. Huh??? Why is this paedophile being transferred to work at another police station when he has such serious allegations against him? He should just get arrested. – Yowe. Whatsapp/SMSs Responses “Zinara tender backfires for director, CAAZ boss” Cde Editor if many veils of incorporation were to be pierced for many companies doing business with public enterprises, cans of corruption worms would be exposed, if I may be allowed to suspect. – Cde Mzvinavhu (Prof).
