The Chronicle Patrick Chitumba, Midlands Bureau Chief ZANU-PF has made significant progress in restructuring party organs in the Midlands province which is part of an elaborate plan to rejuvenate the party. Addressing party members during the Provincial Coordinating Committee meeting last weekend, Midlands Zanu-PF provincial chairperson Engineer Daniel Mackenzie Ncube said the restructuring of party structures is going on well. He said as a party they are happy with reports they are getting from the cell level upwards. “We are making great progress in the restructuring of our party structures from the cell level. We have teams on the ground. Everything is going on smoothly,” said Eng Ncube. The restructuring exercise should rejuvenate the party as it seeks to retain constituencies in its hands and reclaim those in the hands of the opposition. Eng Ncube said the party must be united with members working together. “We have to unite our members, we have to unite the leadership, the legislators and the local authorities so that there is one voice and unity of purpose ahead of the 2023 harmonised elections,” he said. “This cell restructuring exercise is very important and we must be seized with it wherever we are. The cell restructuring exercise protects the party. The cells are the vanguard of the party.” Eng Ncube said Zanu-PF is the only people oriented party with a rich history and socio-economic activities it has championed have changed lives since the country gained independence. “So let’s go out and spread the good news about Zanu-PF and what it has done for the people and the country. We need to walk together as a province. “We don’t want infighting because at the end of the day we are working towards delivering a substantial vote for our MPs, the province and our President,” he said.
