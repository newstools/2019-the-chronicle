The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter ISIPHIWO Sami, Bulawayo high school drama competitions run by Iyasa, are back for their 10th edition. The schools drama competition that is aimed at raising the standard of children’s theatre in Bulawayo schools will be run under the theme, “New Media and the New Generation”. Iyasa spokesperson Mercy Kayumba said: “It’s our 10th edition of Isiphiwo Sami and we’re really excited. Looking back at the journey, it has been amazing as we’ve seen talent grow from high school level to a professional level.” Thirty high schools will be participating in the competition with dates for the preliminary round and finals yet to be announced. Last year, Evelyn High School won the competition with Gifford High School coming in at second place and Emganwini High School third. Explaining this year’s theme, Kayumba said: “This theme was inspired by the fact that we live in a world that now revolves around social media with the Internet now part of our lives. “The new media has its pros and cons and we saw it very important to give them (high school pupils) this theme so that they explore it creatively and also learn the good and bad things about the new media and how they can use it positively.”
