The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Court Reporter A MAN from Bulawayo has been arrested for allegedly attacking his 14-year-old sister with a wheel spanner in a fight over left over food. Courage Makara (21) from Entumbane suburb allegedly attacked his sister in a misunderstanding over sadza and kapenta. The court heard that Makara took his sister’s food that was left the previous night and ate it. His sister got angry and they had an argument resulting in Makara attacking her. Makara pleaded guilty to a physical abuse charge before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu. The magistrate remanded him out of custody on free bail to today for plea recording. Makara said he only punched his sister. “Your Worship, I do admit to the charges levelled against me, I only used fists. I didn’t use any tool to assault her. I only disciplined her as a brother,” he said. Prosecuting, Ms Patience Sibanda said Makara committed the offence on Tuesday this week. Ms Sibanda said the complainant did not sustain visible injuries. The juvenile said her father had gone to work when Makara attacked her. “When I asked the accused person why he was eating my sadza, he took a cooking stick and started assaulting me all over the body with it. As I tried to flee from the scene, he took a wheel spanner and hit me once on the back,” she said.
