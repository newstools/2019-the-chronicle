The Chronicle Brenda Zinyuke, Court Reporter TWO men from Bulawayo have each been sentenced to 10 years in prison for stealing copper wires from a TelOne transformer. Sibangilizwe Maniko (19) and Spencer Gande (23) both of Sizinda suburb were caught redhanded burning the wires by a security guard. The pair who pleaded not guilty to theft, were however convicted by Western Commonage magistrate, Mr Mafios Moyo due to overwhelming evidence. They were each sentenced to effective 10 years in prison. Prosecuting, Mr Simbarashe Manyiwa said on August 11 this year, a security guard was on duty at Sizinda Garden when he saw Maniko and Gande carrying two black bags heading towards Sizinda suburb. The security guard followed them until they got to a certain house in the same suburb. “Upon arrival, the guard found the accused persons burning the copper wires to remove the insulation material,” said Mr Manyiwa. The guard arrested the two accused before handing them over to police at Tshabalala Police Station.—@zinyuke98
