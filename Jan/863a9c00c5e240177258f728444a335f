A-21-YEAR-OLD former Matopo High School pupil is appealing for US$1 500 to get a visa and a flight ticket after securing a sports scholarship to study in US. Matthew Msamanyanda, a high jumper and a sprinter got a scholarship to study at Lindsey Wilson College. In an interview with Chronicle Sports, the sprinter said he has to raise the amount and travel to the US on January 11. “I’m failing to raise money for my visa and the flight ticket, thus I’m appealing for assistance from the Ministry of Sports, corporates and well-wishers. “It has been always my dream to make it as a professional athlete as well as study and now the opportunity has presented itself. It’s my hope that someone out there will be able to help me,” he said. Msamanyanda has been a member of Depaul Athletics Club in Bulawayo for the past two years. Depaul Athletic Club coach Mandla Mgijima described Msamanyanda as “a rare talent”, with a bright future. “The boy has been finding it hard to raise money and this has started to affect him. We take pride in producing such a wonderful talent from our club but we’ll be happier if he successfully goes to the US,” said Mgijima. He said it will be of great benefit for the club and the country if Msamanyanda gets assistance as he is a star in the making. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he wins the gold medals in the next few years in international competitions and becomes a great Zimbabwean ambassador. Last year he was the champion in high jump at national level,” said Mgijima. Msamanyanda represented Zimbabwe at an Under-17 competition held in Lesotho in 2013. — @DecoDecent2
