The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SINGER Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele, comedian/radio personality Babongile Sikhonjwa and dub poet Albert Nyathi dazzled at the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) with their traditional themed attires. Going along with the awards African Royalty theme, the trio went all out and electrified the red carpet on a night that most failed to interpret the theme. A barefooted Sikhonjwa shocked all and sundry as he donned a full Ndebele traditional attire with a small knobkerrie as an accessory. Sandy wore a black and white Umakoti Royal Bridal collection cowhide dress that was from the Umakoti range that was launched last year during a glitzy Royal Bride exhibition by NkaZana collection. Sikhonjwa, who got his outfit from Albert Nyathi who also wore a leopard skin showel, said: “I decided to go full on traditional so as to totally represent my culture. The Nama theme was African Royalty and I decided to represent my tribe with that attire.” He said people were astonished when they saw him. “When people saw me wearing my outfit, they were totally stunned. Everyone wanted to take pictures with me. When Sandra and Albert walked into the venue dressed alike, the three of us stole the show,” said Sikhonjwa. Sandy said it felt great to be the centre of attraction during the awards. “It was a beautiful feeling. I’d told my friends and colleagues that my dress would stand out because a few did not know that women can wear other things besides amaZambia and bring out their royalty at the same time,” she said. Sandy said her dress that was designed by NkaZana celebrates African queens and redefines fashion with a touch of culture.
