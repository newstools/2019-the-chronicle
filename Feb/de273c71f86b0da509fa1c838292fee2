BULAWAYO Basketball League men’s leaders Mavericks face rejuvenated Highlanders A at Khanyisile Sports Centre on Saturday. Highlanders A are brimming with confidence following their stunning win over Giants last week, but will be up against a Mavericks side which is yet to lose a game this season. Mavericks coach Admose Ndlovu said despite being the favourites his team needs to respect their opponents. “Last week was a shocking result when Highlanders A beat Giants, who have most of the best players in the province, but that won’t change our style as we’ll continue playing our offensive game. We’ll apply the ‘Mavericks mentality’ of fighting from the first minute till the end,” said Ndlovu. “We watched them (Highlanders A) in their last encounter and my players have started talking about the importance of beating them. It’s important we win because if we lose the title race will open up.” Mavericks have won all five matches they have played this season, while Highlanders A have played one more, winning four and losing two. Highlanders A coach Theo Weale said last week’s win against defending champions Giants was a morale booster. “The morale is high but as a coach it’s my job to ensure there’s no complacency and we’re looking beyond this game. We’ve got a clear plan on how we’re going to attack and defend since we’ve been working hard during training in preparation for this tough match. “It is no secret that Mavericks are favourites considering they came second last season, but our encounter last week has made the build-up to the match even more exciting. My players will just have to be physically and mentally fit because the motivation is there; what’s left is to demonstrate it on the pitch,” said Weale. In another men’s encounter Nust A will square off against Oilers, while in the women’s league, bottom sides Highlanders and Lakers Juniors take on each other, with Nust and Angels completing the weekend fixtures.
