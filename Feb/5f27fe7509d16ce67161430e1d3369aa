THE Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has warned members of the public to be cautious of scattered violent thunderstorms which will be accompanied by lightning and strong winds in the western parts of the country beginning today. In a statement yesterday, the MSD said the rainfall is coming from Botswana and entering Zimbabwe via Matabeleland provinces, but will generally be light. “Isolated evening thunderstorms are expected over the extreme western districts, namely Bulilima, Mangwe, Hwange, Tsholotsho, Matopo and Gwanda, as moisture drifts into the country from Botswana,” it said. “These storms may be violent, coupled with lightning and strong winds, but generally light rainfall is expected.” The department advised members of the public in the affected districts attending outdoor functions to be cautious as the storms may be violent. Harare Metropolitan and all Mashonaland provinces can expect mostly sunny and hot conditions, with brief cloudy periods and a cooling breeze from time to time. Isolated afternoon and evening rains with thunderstorms remain a possibility, and it will be cool overnight. The MSD said while normal to below normal rains were expected in other parts of the country, chances of an El-Nino induced drought could not be ruled out. “Apart from those nominated areas, elsewhere should be sunny and warmer than of late, though cool in the morning and overnight,” said the department. “In Masvingo and in Manicaland provinces, sunny spells are expected. “The department also urges members of the public to use weather information from the MSD rather than relying on social media as they can be misled.”
