The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls ZIFA Southern Region Division One newcomers Binga Pirates are racing against time to have their home ground ready before the 2019 season starts in about two weeks. Being the only club from Matabeleland North’s Zambezi Riverside district to play in Division One, the community-owned Binga Pirates have to prepare a home ground from scratch. They will be using the Binga High School grounds. The team’s technical advisor Ginford Mupandaguta said work is underway to prepare the ground after which it will be inspected by Zifa. “We will be using Binga High School grounds and we want to put gravel as it is sandy which we hope to finalise this week. We expect Zifa to come and inspect it soon after we finish,” said Mupandaguta. He said the coaching department headed by former Hwange FC and Caps United goalkeeper Witness Munkuli had assembled a 25-member team. The team comprises 80 percent unheralded players from around Binga, with only five acquired from other Division One clubs. Mupandaguta said Binga Pirates will not be playing to add numbers, but to fight for a top six finish. The team is the second to qualify from Division Two in Binga, but the first to play in Division One. Lunda FC, which won a ticket to Division One two years ago, opted out due to financial challenges. “We are hoping to be among the top six. We didn’t sign any big names as the bulk of players are locals, but we have shown we mean business by paying a commitment fee towards registration. We hope to complete registration of players before the season starts,” he said. Mupandaguta appealed to the corporate world, particularly the tourism industry in Binga to assist the club. – @ncubeleon
