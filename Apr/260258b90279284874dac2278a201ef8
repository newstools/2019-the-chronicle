The Chronicle IN March 2015, King Goodwill Zwelithini — the Zulu monarch who wields so much influence in South Africa’s KwaZulu Natal province — sparked worldwide outrage when he called for the expulsion of foreigners from that country because they were taking away jobs from locals and changing the nature of South African society with their amanikiniki. His comments made during an address to youths at a moral regeneration event at Pongola, were publicised widely on radio, newspapers and other media outlets leading to one of the worst episodes of xenophobic violence ever witnessed in South Africa. In his speech, King Zwelithini said when South Africans were in exile they did not settle in other countries and start trading. “Instead, when you were in their countries you helped them to get their freedom. I know that other countries were liberated because of liberation armies from South Africa,” he was quoted saying. “(But now) when you walk in the street you cannot recognise a shop that you used to know because it has been taken over by foreigners, who then mess it up by hanging amanikiniki,” he said. King Zwelithini said foreigners had realised that South Africans were stupid, which was why they were taking over the wealth. Following the address, xenophobic attacks started in Durban and spread to Johannesburg resulting in the deaths of seven foreigners and the destruction of their shops and houses. <img class="size-medium wp-image-444306" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/King-Goodwill-Zwelithini-2-240x360.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="360" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/King-Goodwill-Zwelithini-2-240x360.jpg 240w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/King-Goodwill-Zwelithini-2-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/King-Goodwill-Zwelithini-2-453x680.jpg 453w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/King-Goodwill-Zwelithini-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /> King Goodwill Zwelithini Xenophobia in South Africa usually follows a certain pattern. It manifests itself towards elections and with that country set to hold polls next month, there are fears politicians will play on the insecurities of voters to whip up anti-immigrant and anti-foreigner sentiment. Already, xenophobic attacks flared up in Durban and parts of Limpopo province last week with the outbreak blamed on inflammatory statements by politicians. South Africa has a high unemployment rate and there is a propensity to blame foreigners for stealing jobs from locals. While many foreigners, including Zimbabweans, are hard working and honest people contributing to the growth of South Africa’s economy, there is a tendency to paint all black foreigners as criminals and this has been a source of tension between them and the locals. Like any other African country, we acknowledge that South Africa is still to address several issues affecting the majority black population post-independence and these include service delivery, housing, jobs, education and so on. The disparity in wealth between blacks and whites is still big hence the simmering tensions among black communities. However, their anger is wrongly directed at fellow black brothers from Africa who are also struggling to eke out a living. This is why we condemn in the strongest terms, the latest outbreak of xenophobic attacks on foreigners and call on the South African government to clamp down hard on the violence. KwaZulu-Natal once again was a hotspot for xenophobic violence after two people were killed in violence last week. Local residents raided the homes of some foreign nationals, forcing them to seek refuge at nearby police stations and mosques. We note the statement by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa condemning violence against foreigners and calling on law enforcement agencies to act against those who commit xenophobic crimes. “As South Africans, we owe our freedom to the solidarity and support given to our liberation struggle by people across our continent and around the world,” President Ramaphosa said in a brief statement. We also welcome the strong message of support from Economic Freedom Fighters president Julius Malema who vociferously called out South Africans instigating attacks against foreigners. “We are all Africans. We must love one another. Showing love to those who come from Mozambique, showing love to those who come from Guinea, from Egypt, from Nigeria is self-love. When you love yourself, you will love fellow South Africans,” said Mr Malema during an address at a rally in Cape Town last week. “You say the people from Nigeria and Zimbabwe are taking our jobs. But here are whites in South Africa who don’t have papers. They entered here illegally. The Chinese, some of them do not have papers. You don’t call them Amakwerekwere. You don’t beat them up but you beat fellow Africans, why? You hate yourself”. We reported yesterday that African diplomats have appealed to the South African Government to ensure that political parties in that country avoid inflammatory statements against foreigners as this might spark xenophobic attacks. We hope their pleas will be heard and the                                                                                                  South African government will lean on politicians to exercise restraint on the campaign trail. Xenophobia is barbaric, archaic and primitive. It does not have a place in modern society and we find the latest incidents in South Africa regrettable and unfortunate. Africa should be moving more towards integration and xenophobia is a stumbling block in the attainment of that goal. The bloodletting should stop forthwith.
