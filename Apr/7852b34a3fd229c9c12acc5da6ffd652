Mbaserah added that this is the most anticipated movie in years. “Everyone had been rushing to get a ticket, the vibe around this movie is unique; Avengers is definitely the most anticipated movie of the decade,” he said. This follows global trends where Avengers End Game tickets have been flying off the shelves in different countries breaking records in the process. The movie follows Avengers: Infinity War where half of all life in the universe was killed due to the actions of Thanos. The remaining Avengers and their allies must re-assemble to reverse those actions in one final stand. Zimbabwe’s Danai Gurira will feature in the movie as part of the storyline through her character Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje, Wakanda’s all-female special forces from the block buster Black Panther. Gurira’s character will feature alongside superheroes such as Ironman, Captain America, Hulk, Thor and Antman as they battle the super villain Thanos. —@mlauzikeith
