BULAWAYO Province will today hold the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) inter-district track and field competitions at White City Stadium. The participating districts are Reigate, Mzilikazi, Bulawayo Central, Khami and Imbizo. Mzilikazi, which has 10 schools, is the district to beat after dominating since the format was changed from inter-zonal to district competitions. Bulawayo will be looking to come up with a strong team to represent the province in the national competitions at Midlands Christian College in Gweru from March 25 to 28. “The preparations for the competitions are at an advanced stage as teams have already registered their athletes. We want to choose the best possible team to represent Bulawayo Metropolitan Province at the national competitions,” said Bulawayo Nash head-in-charge of athletics Peter Gambiza.
