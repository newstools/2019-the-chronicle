The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter SUBURBAN District won the ZRP Bulawayo Province inter-districts football challenge held at Raylton Club, beating Traffic District 3-2 on penalties after the match ended goalless in regulation time on Friday. The game capped a two-day competition that saw districts competing in seven sporting disciplines, as part of a process to assemble a team to represent ZRP in the Southern African Police (SAPOL) games to be held in Angola on a date yet to be confirmed. Other sporting disciplines were tennis, netball, darts, volleyball and chess. The national finals will be held in Harare. Bulawayo West District won the netball event, while Bulawayo Central were tops in the men’s darts. Nkulumane district claimed gold in the women’s chess category followed by Bulawayo Central. Officer commanding Bulawayo Province, Commissioner Bernard Dumbura, who was the guest of honour, applauded the athletes for grasping the opportunity to showcase their talent. “You’ve all aspired to win, but there’s only one winner. I appeal to all of you to practise collective effort as individualism will not take you anywhere. Sport gives you a platform to promote team work and you’ve been given a chance to showcase your talent,” said Dumbura. “Your next stop is against Mat North and it is another challenge. I have so much confidence that you are going to come out victorious,” he said. Sports officer for Bulawayo Province Assistant Inspector Maxwell Nyandoro said apart from assembling a squad for the SAPOL games, the event helps athletes gain fitness and promote good working relations among police officers from different stations. “All Bulawayo districts have shown great commitment throughout the course of our journey. They also demonstrated a high level of professionalism during games in all sporting disciplines,” said Nyandoro. — @DecoDecent2
