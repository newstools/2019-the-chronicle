CHIEF Shumba of the ED Pfee hit song has released another song titled, Angel of Hope where he praises First Lady, Amai Auxilia Mnangagwa, for the role that she is playing in improving the livelihoods of Zimbabweans. Chief Shumba, whose music is mostly centred on people’s day to day lives, said he decided to sing about the First Lady as she is a woman who is keen to improve the lives of people in Zimbabwe through her Angel of Hope Foundation. “Our First Lady has been highly active and doing good for society through her many projects where she has been speaking against early child marriages, raising cancer awareness and urging people to practice cleanliness among many other things,” said Cde Shumba. Chief Shumba’s band manager, John Muchenje, also appreciated the role played by the First Lady in the country. “She restored the dignity of Zimbabwean women through her humility and respect for other people. She’s a role model to many as she voluntarily left her Chirumanzu-Zibagwe constituency to do charity work (uplifting lives of disadvantaged children and other vulnerable members of society). This shows that she is a mother to many. . . Zimbabwe is blessed to have a woman of that calibre and we thank God for her,” said Muchenje. With six albums to his name, Chief Shumba said Angel of Hope was released two weeks ago and is already receiving airplay from Radio Zimbabwe. He said the track is part of his forthcoming 10-track album, Simbarashe, that is due for release soon. Other tracks will include the title track Simbarashe, Sango Renharo, Dziva Rerudo, Shery and Kumagumo. “I mostly sing about love, culture and religion as my thrust is to capture the way people live together,” he said. Simbarashe, Chief Shumba said, talks about a person who is filled with God’s power and is praying for those who tried to bewitch him and failed.
