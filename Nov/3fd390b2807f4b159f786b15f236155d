The Chronicle Cape Town – Kaizer Chiefs assistant coach Shaun Bartlett has warned against over-confidence as Amakhosi continue strengthening their Absa Premiership lead. Coach Ernst Middendorp’s charges are sitting pretty at the top of the league standings with a 10-point lead over Mamelodi Sundowns after winning nine of their opening 11 fixtures. Some have ventured to claim that Chiefs are now strong favourites to end their four-year trophy drought by lifting the Absa Premiership silverware, but Bartlett doesn’t want expectations to get out of control. “Anything is possible but like I said, it’s still early days, we’ve only played 11 games so far,” said Bartlett, according to IOL. “Nobody is given a league title in November or December. We’ve got to be consistent and continue doing what we’ve been doing for the last four months. “I think that is key. There’s six, seven months to go this season and we’ve got to make sure that we stay consistent.” Chiefs will be aiming to move a step closer to lifting their first piece of silverware when they face Maritzburg United in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout on Sunday. – Sport24.
