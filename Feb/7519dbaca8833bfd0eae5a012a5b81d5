ZIMDANCEHALL musician Winky D is Adam, pop singer Gemma Griffiths is Eve and she is carrying a snake (the Devil) in the Garden of Eden. These are some of the themes that are littered in their new music video titled, MuGarden. The video, released yesterday on YouTube, is a vast improvement for Winky D who had become synonymous with boring music videos such as Disappear and Ngirozi. But with MuGarden, Winky D went all out as it has an international standard and shows that a lot of work was put into it. The setting was ideal with the two paired in a garden with lush lawns and exotic fruits, looking like they were in paradise. What was striking for many people is how Gemma easily sings in chiShona complementing Winky D’s lyrics on the song produced by award-winning Oskid. South Africa-born Gemma, who was raised in Harare, is not a new face as she once won the hearts of many when she sang a rendition of Jah Prayzah’s Mudhara Vachauya as well as Oliver Mtukudzi’s Neria. Commenting on the music video that has already been viewed over 20 000 times, a few hours after its release, one Justice Gonde said Gemma nailed it adding that the video was on point. “Gemma nailed it more than what I was expecting. She even went on to finish the piece in Shona. Visual presentation, lyrics and timing all in order. Well done to Winky and Gemma,” commented Gonde.
