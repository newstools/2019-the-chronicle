The Chronicle Tendai Rupapa, Harare Bureau Former Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Prisca Mupfumira had her fourth freedom bid thrown out yesterday by a Harare magistrate who ruled that she was a flight risk. Mupfumira is facing seven counts of criminal abuse of office involving US$95 million. Mr Elijah Makomo said although some of the counts faced by Mupfumira involved intricate investigations which are yet to be completed, the other three counts showed there was strong case against her. He said because of the gravity of the offence she is facing, she is likely to abscond if granted bail. The State said Mpfumira had two passports, an ordinary one and a diplomatic one. The ordinary passport has a multiple-entry visa to the United Kingdom and this 10-year visa is expiring in May 2028. “The 10-year visa was obviously acquired not for Government business travel but personal business. What this confirms is that she has strong connections within that country. Certainly the United Kingdom would not grant such a visa at the mere asking, especially to a woman of straw as she is portrayed by her counsel,” said Mr Michael Reza for the State. Mupfumira, through her lawyer, Mr Charles Chinyama, made a fresh bail application last Friday following the expiry of her 21-day detention period. She also made another application challenging her arrest and detention on the basis that the police officers who arrested her were seconded to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) and therefore did not have arresting powers. In dismissing the application for refusal of further remand, Mr Makomo said a detention on reasonable suspicion that an offence was committed is obviously not unlawful because it is sanctioned by the law. “I did not hear the defence counsel arguing that the facts contained in the State papers do not show reasonable suspicion that the accused committed the offences alleged,” he said. Mr Makomo remanded her in custody to September 29.updated
