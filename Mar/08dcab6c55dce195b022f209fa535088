The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter The dusty streets of Nehosho suburb in Gweru were a hive of activity on Friday as more than a 1 000 people attended a free street bash, commonly known as Passa Passa, that was staged there. The street bash organised by new Gweru music promotion company, Zvikwengwere Entertainment, was also meant to celebrate their member – El Xander’s birthday. It was held at Nehosho Tuckshops. An exclusive VIP party was held at a private residence, a stone throw from the venue of the street party. MSU students who attended the event in their numbers, were lured to the bash by the lineup of Gweru’s Zimdancehall musician Legion, Bulawayo-based Home of House sounds DJ The Doc, Xiddo, Munya Unruly, G Fresh and Zimboy. The event was held in the suburb where most MSU students reside and is also a walking distance for those that reside at the campus. Entertaining the crowd were Gweru’s up-and-coming artistes Ray Vines, Jah Soshes, Tiddy and Tiff Cake who gave a good account of themselves while DJ Obz kept people on their feet. Ending the show was Legion who performed just before midnight. He proved why he is regarded the best Zimdancehall artiste in Gweru as the crowd sang along to his hits Tipeiwo Hwahwa, Mudhara Wemangoma and Tinodhakwa Here. The street bash that was a huge success considering that it was the first of its kind in the ghetto, showed that the city’s Zimdancehall artistes, if given a chance, can attract huge crowds. Organiser of the show, El Xander said they were pleased with the attendance as this was their first show as a promotion company. “This was our first show as Zvikwengwere Entertainment and we’re very happy with the attendance,” he said.
