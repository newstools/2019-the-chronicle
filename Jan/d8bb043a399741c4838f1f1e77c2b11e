NEWLY nominated Bulawayo Wushu Association (BWA) president Giyani Moyo has said the association’s immediate task is to make their existence felt and will soon embark on a vigorous campaign to popularise the sport in the city. Moyo was voted president at elections held at Pumula High School last month. The new executive saw Dingani Ngwenya elected as the vice-president, Anitta Dube as the treasurer while Gladius Utete was elected new director of marketing and sponsorship. Millard Mangena is the chief instructor with Silvester Nyoni, Dube and Chishamiso Mufushwa elected as committee members. “Our aim is to spread the sport to the grassroots level so our focus will be at schools and communities taking advantage of various youth centres around the city. “We are also aiming at coming up with structures in Khami, Reigate, Imbizo Bulawayo Central and Mzilikazi districts,” said Moyo. To spread the sport in Bulawayo, Moyo said, the new executive had come up with a four-point plan that will guide their operations. He said the first phase will be to promote Wushu at primary schools and community centres targeting women. “In our plan we want to involve more women into the sport because few women are taking up the sport. To do that we will work hand-in-hand with the National Association of Primary School Heads (Naph) and National Association for Secondary School Heads (Nash) so that the sport begins at lower levels,” said Moyo. He said the second phase will be to hold exhibition fights at different venues in the city. “We will then hold competitions around the city and award individuals that would have excelled,” said Moyo. Wushu is similar to kung fu and is an exhibition and full contact combat sport that allows the use of protective gear like headgear, gloves and leather armour. It is of Chinese origin and Wu means military while Shu is art in Chinese hence the art has military inclinations. — @khumzallen
