The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter ZIMDANCEHALL chanter, Killer T, proved he is still a force to reckon with in music circles as he managed to fill up The Vista in Bulawayo on Friday. The musician, who was supported by Cue Movement DJs, took to the stage at around 1AM and performed his latest single Ane Chaanogona live for the first time. He also performed his hit songs Kana Ndamuda, Vanongovenga and Rovai Makuva from his last release. His latest single Ane Chaanogona was well embraced by the fans showing that he hit the right chord with the track. After his performance, Killer T said: “It was great seeing a huge turnout at the show. It’s always great being in Bulawayo and I loved the energy from the fans, just seeing people singing along to my songs.” The chanter said fans should expect more music from him this year as he has a lot lined up. The Zimdancehall genre has seen a surge of new artistes, something which has made it challenging for the pioneers of the genre to remain relevant. Artistes like Guspy Warrior, for example, are among those who seem to be fast losing their relevance after only a handful of people attended his show in Bulawayo recently. So when Killer T announced he was coming to the city, most wanted to test his popularity and he did not disappoint after many thronged his show.
