The Chronicle Response to “Govt, Zanu-PF warn MDC-A”. The MDC-A leader instigated violence in August, 2018 and January, 2019. He must calculate his speeches and not incite his followers he once labelled as stupid after some lost their lives in the August, 2018 violence. Use of figurative violent language that may be misconstrued by his followers is dangerous and should be avoided. As a trained Christian pastor he should preach like Jesus Christ. Did Jesus tell his followers to be violent when they lose to their political opponents in free and fair elections? Jesus would not support any political leader who commits political adultery with external forces in support of sanctions against the nation of Israel. When people suffer because of sanctions induced economic Aids, no political leader should then threaten to make the country ungovernable. We challenge MDC-A to proffer clear alternative ideas than the current economic reforms to correct our economic ills, caused mainly by the satanic sanctions. The MDC-A is naive and thinks that the West will pamper Zimbabwe with cheap economic aid that will resurrect our economy when Zanu-PF departs from governing. This is the height of political myopia. The US hates Zanu-PF mainly because of our land reform, not human rights or electoral whatever disputes. Can Chamisa tell Africa why there are no sanctions in Uganda and Kenya despite electoral disputes in those countries? — Mzvinavhu.
