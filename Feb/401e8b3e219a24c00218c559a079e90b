The Chronicle Walter Mswazie in Masvingo
A MINISTERIAL delegation is set to visit Tugwi-Mukosi Dam on a familiarisation tour to assess progress towards implementation of 14 identified economic projects around the water resource. Masvingo Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Ezra Chadzamira, said the visit, which was initially set for last Wednesday, was postponed to a later date due to other commitments. Two weeks ago, a delegation of permanent secretaries led by Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Mr Justin Mupamhanga, also visited the dam site on a similar mission. “I am happy that the projects at Tugwi-Mukosi will soon be taking off given that we are going to host an inter-ministerial delegation in the next few days. “This comes after yet another delegation of permanent secretaries and principal directors led by Mr Mupamhanga came here and identified 14 projects to be undertaken,” said Minister Chadzamira. He said Tugwi-Mukosi Dam was going to be a game changer in turning the whole province into a greenbelt through agriculture, fisheries, tourism and hospitality industry as well as wildlife management. “While waiting for a master plan, a detailed framework has been produced and it will help in the planning process. We already know that there are 14 projects to be undertaken at the dam. Chief among them is the 25 000 hectares of irrigation, which will be unveiled, cable-car project, among others. “Such visits are invigorating our energies towards the massive water body with a potential of turning the whole province into an economic power house,” said the minister. “We look forward to start engaging investors after the inter-ministerial visit.” A 15-megawatt hydro-power plant is set to be built at the dam. — @walterbmswazie2
