An 18 YEAR OLD man has appeared in court for allegedly stealing $100 and property valued at more than $400 from his sister with help of his friends. Tadiwa Kagwidza (18), Bongani Kayombo (31), Lazarus Ngwarati (21) and Brian Nkomo (22) appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mrs Adelaide Mbeure who remanded them in custody to today for plea recording. The court heard the four reside in Thorngrove suburb. Tadiwa lives with his sister Ms Josephine Kagwidza. Prosecuting, Mr Mufaro Mageza said last week on Monday the four allegedly hatched a plan to steal from Ms Kagwidza’s house after Tadiwa was left home alone. When his sister came back in the evening on the same day, she met two men coming out of her house. When she asked them what they wanted, they told her they were looking for her brother. When she proceeded to the house she noticed a broken window and found out that some of her property and money had been stolen. Tadiwa went back home at around 9PM. When his sister asked him what had happened, he said he did not know because he had left home earlier in afternoon, the court heard. “On January 7 the four men allegedly hatched a plan to stage an unlawful entry and theft. As per their plan they broke a window of a spare room and allegedly took 10m fence, two blankets, 4 metal poles, two zinc sheets and $100,” said Mr Mageza. The court heard investigations were carried out leading to the four’s arrest. Money, zinc sheets and 1m fence were recovered. The total value of property stolen was $431 and goods valued at $260 were recovered. The $100 was also not recovered. – @gwizi_n
