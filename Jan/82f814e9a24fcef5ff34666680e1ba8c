NEWLY promoted Zifa Southern Region Division One League side Ajax Hotspurs is looking for partners to assist in refurbishing Bango Grounds in Mpopoma for them to continue playing their league matches at the venue. The club has been playing its Zifa Bulawayo Division Two league home games at the venue and hopes to continue doing so despite the possibility that it might not pass an inspection test. Siphambaniso Dube, the Ajax Hotspurs director, said the club had a lot of supporters in and around Mpopoma that would want to support them at all their home matches. “We understand that creating a financial arrangement to find a partnership to renovate Bango Grounds won’t be easy, but we’re embarking on this long journey for the club. The project will be the first step for the community to advance its cause of creating a legendary sporting facility,” said Dube. He said for that reason, it will be a special place for Mpopoma since it will not only benefit his club, but all other emerging clubs within the community. “From the club’s perspective, the stadium will complement and accelerate plans already in place for making Ajax a powerful club. We’re appealing to all businesses to assist in any way so that the dream of many young kids can be accomplished,” he said. Ajax Hotspurs will be conducting trials at the same venue on Saturday and Dube said it will also mark the beginning of training for the coming season. — @DecoDecent2
