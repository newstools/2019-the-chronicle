The Chronicle Elita Chikwati, Harare Bureau All is set for the National Environment Cleaning Day today, with Government now focusing on cleaning and greening the environment.
Greening refers to selection and planting of plants on, in, or next to buildings and in public parks for environmental benefits and also improving the visual design of surfaces. President Mnangagwa declared the first Friday of each calendar month as a National Environment Cleaning Day, as the Government moves to ensure the country has sustainable environment management and waste disposal systems. Environment, Tourism and Hospitality Industry secretary Mr Munesuishe Munodawafa yesterday said all was set for today’s programme, with Acting President Kembo Mohadi leading the campaign in Glen View, with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga cleaning at Marlborough Civic Centre.
“Stakeholders have mobilised people and resources,” he said. “The Acting President Cde Mohadi will be leading the clean-up campaign in Glen View, while Vice President Constantino Chiwenga will also be participating in the clean-up exercise at Marlborough Civic Centre. “The acting Minister of Environment, Mangaliso Ndlovu, will join residents in Plumtree. Ministers of States will also be taking part in the exercise in their respective provinces.” Mr Munodawafa said there has been a great response from the companies and the general public, with the number of corporates participating and areas being cleaned increasing every month. “We are pleased that churches and their leaderships have also come along,” he said. “We appeal to other organisations to consider adopting streets or pavements of streets or any other areas of interest in cleaning them up and greening them up.
