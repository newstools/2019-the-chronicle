The Chronicle Showbiz Correspondent AMAKHOSI Cultural Centre is set to hold a creative master class workshop camp during the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair week where people will be taught how to play musical instruments, record music, act, write, dance and sing. Dubbed ZITF Arts and Culture Camp @ Amakhosi Cultural Centre, the programme is expected to run from April 20 to 30 and is targeting teenagers and school children. This year’s ZITF will run from April 23 to 27 at the Zimbabwe International Exhibition Centre. It will be held under the theme: “Propagating Industrial Growth through Trade and Investment”. Charles Msungah, the Amakhosi Cultural Centre artistic director, said participants who will come up with outstanding creations will get a chance to showcase their works at ZITF open spaces. “During the ZITF public days, participants from the Arts and Culture Camp will go to the ZITF grounds and Exhibitor Stands and present what they will have created at the creative workshops. This will be a way of showcasing their creativity and creating a unique entertaining atmosphere at ZITF,” Msungah said. He said participation was open to everyone and countries exhibiting can bring their own arts and culture artefacts for intercultural exchange. “ZITF is an international event. Countries that are exhibiting at ZITF and want to bring their cultural and heritage experience for promoting intercultural conversations and dialogue are welcome to register to bring participants to the Arts and Culture Camp – the first of its kind in Bulawayo,” said Msungah.
