The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau AUTHORITIES at Beitbridge border post have heightened their anti-smuggling drive following the recent interception of three South Africa registered tankers smuggling a combined 116 000 litres of petrol from the neighbouring country. It is also understood that a customs clearing agent linked to the case has gone into hiding following the incident that occurred on April 22. The Chronicle is reliably informed that the fuel, which has a special excise duty of between RTGS$2,20 and RTGS$2,5 per litre, has since been disposed through an auction for around US$260 000.
