The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe University Sports Association (Zusa) games kicked off yesterday at National University of Science and Technology and various supporting venues around Bulawayo. Nine state universities and five church-run universities have arrived in Bulawayo for the event. The games being played are golf, volleyball, handball, cricket, athletics, hockey, table tennis, karate and taekwondo. Zusa president Life Chenhere said: “We’re happy for our hosts for holding such a prestigious annual event as they’ve acquired good supporting venues. They tried their level best for example the hockey stadium at Khumalo is perfect and we’re happy there’s a huge turnout. “The weather is also favourable today (yesterday) and we’re hoping for a successful competition during our stay at Nust.” He thanked the local organising committee for working tirelessly to ensure the event goes smoothly. He said the games are part of the journey that will see them hosting Zimbabwe Tertiary Institute Students Union (Zitusu) games in Harare to come up with Team Zimbabwe that will go for World Universities Games to be held in Napoli, Italy. “As Zusa we thank the universities for deliberately promoting sports by accepting students with seemingly low points but good in sports. We acknowledge the support as it shows that as a country we’re moving towards the right direction,” he said. Chenhere said the event is also a way of marketing the universities and is optimistic that the athletes will be exposed to high profile activities. “We have to raise a bar by comparing ourselves with world class institutions around the world and for us to do that we’re calling for partnership to make this a bigger event. — @DecentDube2
