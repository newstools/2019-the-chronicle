The Chronicle Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau ZANU-PF Members of Parliament and members charged with improving people lives must work hard and deliver in line with the party’s elections manifesto. The party and Government must also concentrate on its election mandate and obligations to deliver as expected by Zimbabweans and ignore political rantings by opposition parties among them the MDC Alliance. This was said by the party’s national political commissar Cde Victor Matemadanda during a meeting with war veterans, widows, war collaborators and youths from Beitbridge last week. “Zanu-PF won the last election fair and square and I don’t see a reason why we should play into the MDC’s game of making noise at the expense of service delivery,” he said. “Since the last election, those in the opposition establishment have been making noise claiming to have won the elections. They have taken their issues to all the places they could but the case remains the same. “As Zanu-PF cadres you must know that the work is cut out for you and the people have given us the mandate to lead and push for national and economic development. At the end of the five year term, Zimbabweans will realise who is fooling them.” Cde Matemadanda said the period of politicking is over hence Government and Zanu-PF leaders must expend their energies on progressive things. The national commissar implored Zimbabweans to jealously guard against those who want to reverse the gains of the liberation struggle. “We went to war to fight colonisation and we defeated the enemy and now they are back with neo-colonialism with the aid of opposition political parties,” he said. “So we need to be aware of such characters among us as Zimbabweans. Our independence was hard won and we cannot sell out and renege on the founding ideals of this country.”
