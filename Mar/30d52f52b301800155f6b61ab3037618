The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter AFRO pop artiste, Ammara Brown, has reflected on her career saying she is grateful for the M-Net Idols Africa singing contest as it shot her into fame 11 years ago. Ammara, Adeona Maboreke and Mkhululi Bhebhe impressed on the reality show that was held in Nairobi, Kenya as they made the Top 6, putting a lot of spotlight on Zimbabwe. To top it all off, a Zimbabwean, Eric Moyo, who is now with Joyous Celebration, won. Ammara, daughter of the late Andy Brown, said her appearance on the show that was aired on DStv’s M-Net channels put her in the limelight and effectively kick-started her music career. “Idols was one of the most defining points in my professional career on several fronts. At the time (when she competed), I had a fear of cameras but through the coaching I received on the show, I learnt to manage this fear. “I also learnt to ask for help and renewed my faith in God and today, I’m an award-winning artiste!” The Akiliz hit-maker, who was 19 then, recalled how she developed ulcers before she performed at the Idols top six finals. “I think my favourite moment on Idols Africa was my Top 6 performance. The stress of the show had taken its toll on me and I eventually developed ulcers. I could barely eat or stand but I asked God to hold me up for five minutes on stage while I performed Brenda Fassie’s Vulindlela. “I was rewarded with a roaring, appreciative crowd and amazing feedback from the judges. That’s such a beautiful memory for me and reflects so much of what I learned on the show,” Ammara said. She said shows like Idols that aim to groom up-and-coming young stars are very important as they help them (artistes) to develop their inherent talents. <img class="size-medium wp-image-442593" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Ammara-Brown-360x240.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Ammara-Brown-360x240.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Ammara-Brown-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Ammara-Brown-680x453.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/03/Ammara-Brown.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Ammara Brown “Zimbabweans have to utilise every respectable opportunity provided to them as artistes and otherwise, particularly in a country that nurtures so little among her people. Where our citizens face such challenges, it is a blessing to have a corporate like DStv that endorses the positive progression of our people,” Ammara said. Since appearing on the Idols stage, Ammara has developed rapidly into a multi-award winning singer, instrumentalist, dancer, songwriter, producer, actress, brand ambassador and philanthropist. She has shared stages with artistes such as Oliver Mtukudzi, Kirk Franklin, Hugh Masekela, HHP, P-Square, Lira and participated in international showcases such as Sauti Za Busara and Hifa. The artiste, who last year collaborated with Nigeria’s Mr Eazi, said her hope is to inspire a generation to break down Africa’s borders. “I’m a symbol of female strength, humble liberty and artistic integrity. As much as I’m proudly Zimbabwean, I hope to inspire a generation to break down Africa’s borders. “Together, Africa could be more powerful than most Africans would even dare to imagine. I want to ‘creatively integrate’ with as many Africans as possible and share this idea so that we learn to embrace our differences and move forward as one in the spirit of Ubuntu.” Off music, Ammara, who was this week featured on MultiChoice’s Heroes’ Stories, has made a heartfelt plea to Zimbabweans to help their countrymen who were ravaged by Cyclone Idai through donations of food, clothing and blankets. “In the near distance, Cyclone Idai is destroying lives faster than we’re saving them. Please take a moment to collect blankets, clothes, food, water and toiletries. Please give whatever you can, even if it’s just a jersey,” said Ammara.
