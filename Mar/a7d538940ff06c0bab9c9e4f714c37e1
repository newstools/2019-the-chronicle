SEVEN primary and secondary school zones from Tsholotsho district will tomorrow and Friday meet at Mavela Secondary School for the track and field athletics competition where a district team will also be selected. The district team, which according to the National Association of Secondary School Heads (Nash) head-in-charge of athletics Philip Phiri, will clash against other districts in the provincials at Mosi oa Tunya High School in Victoria Falls next week. “We are doing our vetting tomorrow (today) before competition gets underway on Thursday right up to Friday. “Our plan as Nash is to take at least 70 athletes to Victoria Falls,” said Phiri, who is also the headmaster of Mate Secondary School. The district came fourth out of seven districts in last year’s provincials and Phiri is confident that they will perform better this time around. “Obviously, that wasn’t a very good performance by us last year and we hope to better our position this year, so we really need to take our strongest possible team to Victoria Falls,” said Phiri. Meanwhile, the Bubi district team goes into camp at Somvubu High School today, according to head-in-charge Cain Ncube. “We selected 70 athletes and grouped them according to middle distance, sprints, horizontal jumps, vertical jumps and throws. We have nine coaches, which means a coach for a specific group,” said Ncube. The district conducted its district competitions at Somvubu High School last week where the hosts came first, dethroning Inyathi High School, which has long dominated the event in the district.
