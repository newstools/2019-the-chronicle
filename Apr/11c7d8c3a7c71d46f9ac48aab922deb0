The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent KWAITO outfit, Stiff’s front man Delaney “Diliza” Dondo will not be on stage anytime soon as he has developed a chest infection that is affecting his performances. In December last year, the South Africa-based artiste, whose group was signed by Professor’s Proper Files record label, fell ill during the downsized Kalawa Homecoming Party at Cosmopolitan Night Club in Bulawayo. He could barely perform as he complained of having shortness of breath just before the show. It seems he has not recovered. This week, he told his fans on Facebook that he would not be performing because of the medical condition. Fans took the news with shock and worry. In a follow up interview, Diliza said although he is not bedridden, he has decided to take a break from performing. “It’s not a big thing. I think I have to take a break a bit until I’m 100 percent fit. I just want to be behind the scenes for a while,” he said. “But I’d like to thank my fans for the concern they showed me.” Explaining his condition, Diliza said he has water in his lungs. “My lungs are filled with water and this causes them to put pressure on my heart. That pressure causes my heart to not function properly leading me to have shortness of breath whenever I perform. “It’s not as bad as in December though, I just need to rest,” said Diliza. However, Diliza said his condition will not deter him from churning out hits in the studio. “I’ll be in studio until I die. This temporary setback won’t affect our recordings as Stiff. As I speak, I’m in Professor’s studio with Stiff working on a couple of songs.”
