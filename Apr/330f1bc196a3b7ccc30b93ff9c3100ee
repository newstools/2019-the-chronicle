The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Chronicle Reporter THE Bulawayo City Council has donated 526 blankets and RTGS $30 000 to cyclone Idai victims in Chimanimani. The handover was done at Oasis church in Belmont on Friday last week. In a telephone interview, Bulawayo Mayor Councillor Solomon Mguni said the local authority bought the blankets in response to distress calls in the cyclone ravaged areas. “We responded to the Press call to assist the people of Chimanimani and it is our social responsibility as Zimbabweans to help others. It’s with a heavy heart that we come as the community of Bulawayo to assist people who have been affected by floods in Chimanimani,” said Cllr Mguni. He said local authorities had a meeting in Harare where they agreed to assist Idai survivors in Chimanimani. “We had a meeting in Harare attended by representatives from 32 urban councils under the Urban Councils Association of Zimbabwe where we planned on how to assist with infrastructure which was damaged in Chimanimani,” said Cllr Mguni. He said the Bulawayo City Council is trying to promote the spirit of ubuntu, which is helping each other. “We felt that an injury to Chimanimani is also an injury to Bulawayo, we are all humans. We are promoting ubuntu as Africans, helping each other as citizens of Zimbabwe,” Cllr Mguni said. Recently, Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister, Judith Ncube, appealed to people in the province to join the rest of the country in assisting with donations for people who were affected by tropical Cyclone Idai-induced floods. —@sharonbuwe
