The Chronicle Zifa should start thinking of having Norman Mapeza and Madinda Ndlovu, as assistant coaches to Sunday Chidzambwa. It is high time the Warriors go to the quarter finals of Afcon. Mapeza had a lesson or two in the Champions League and Madinda just knows how to work with young players. We have a youthful squad which is capable of bringing Afcon home. – Fortune, Nketa, Bulawayo Response to “Government mulls pension payout hike”. What a splendid idea by the authorities should the idea be implemented. Most pensioners like yours truly suffer from chronic illnesses like athritis, diabetes, hypertension (BP) and the odd ones related to old age. The $100 bond monthly payout I get from NSSA is spent on medication, the prices which continue to escalate, leaving me with virtually nothing for basics. Should the suggestion to increase the pension payouts be implemented it will surely bring smiles to the suffering pensioners. – Ndabitshekileh, Hillside, Bulawayo
