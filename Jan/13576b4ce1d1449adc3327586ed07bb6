The Chronicle Response to “Govt bans SA animal imports over foot-n-mouth”. Quick observation by veterinary doctors. It feels good to know there are workers working with all the heart to protect citizens’ health. Hope the spirit is spread to all other civil servants or workers. – Kunhuwa. Response to “Doctors’ strike over”. This is good news to hear. We thank God that doctors have listened to Government’s call to return to work. It is very mature of them. We don’t need confusion in this country. All we want is peace. — Musiyiwa. Response to “Corruption fuels chaos at service stations”. Yes, the elite few have profited greatly from this situation, driving around town despite the situation the country is in. You even see children driving the latest model luxury vehicles. There is a huge wealth gap in our country. Corruption is indeed alive and well. I am running out of patience for this selfish nation. There is a lack of pride and integrity in our people. – Bert.
