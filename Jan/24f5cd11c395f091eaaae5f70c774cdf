ZIMBABWE Cricket chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani heads to India today to negotiate the Chevrons tour of the Asian country which is scheduled for March. Mukuhlani is going to India with ZC acting managing director Givemore Makoni for a meeting with Board of Control for Cricket in India in Mumbai tomorrow (Wednesday). The ZC boss said it is the norm for all tours between Zimbabwe and India to be discussed between the two boards. Zimbabwe’s tour of India is under threat following the announcement of new dates for the 2019 Indian Premier League. The richest league in the world will this year run from 29 March to 19 May because of the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup in England which starts on 30 May. “We are going to meet the BCCI regarding India’s tour to Zimbabwe and I am going with our acting MD Givemore Makoni. We always negotiate all the tours, we have always done that, IPL has always been there, nothing is new here. We are meeting the BCCI officials on Wednesday,’’ Mukuhlani said. With a few days between Australia’s tour of India in March, Zimbabwe’s visit to India could be shortened or even played at a later date. “We are confident that the tour will go ahead, we will talk more after our meeting with BCCI,’’ Mukuhlani said. According to the FTP, Zimbabwe are meant to tour India in March for a Test and three ODIs. There were plans to convince India to instead tour Zimbabwe as that would financially benefit the financially challenged ZC but with the new developments, it is hard to see that happening. — @Mdawini_29
