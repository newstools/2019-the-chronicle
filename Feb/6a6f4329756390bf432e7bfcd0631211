ZORA music exponent, Leonard “Karikoga” Zhakata, will tomorrow be in Kwekwe for a show at The Club (Mbizo 4 Shopping Centre). Backed by the Zimbabwe All Stars Band, the Upenyu Mutoro hit-maker is expected to rekindle his romance with fans in the mining town. Zimbabwe All Stars band manager, Ben Zhakata, said: “I urge all our fans to come in their numbers as we promise nothing but a top drawer performance.” He said they would play both old and new songs from a forthcoming album. Zhakata is expected to play tracks that propelled him to stardom like Upenyu Mutoro, Batai Mazwi, Gomba Remarara and Maruva Enyika. Meanwhile, Chimurenga guru, Thomas “Mukanya” Mapfumo, who was meant to perform at Gulez Gardens tomorrow, will no longer be coming. He was expected to share the stage with Dendera musician Sulumani Chimbetu. Show promoter, Abel “Yellow Malewa” Chakazama confirmed that the show had been cancelled as Mukanya had commitments elsewhere. However, a source privy to the goings on revealed that Mukanya made hefty and huge demands that the promoter failed to meet. “Mukanya made huge demands that would have put the promoter in the red so he decided to be diplomatic and cancelled the show. In fact, they agreed that the show be cancelled, it was by mutual consent,” said the source.
