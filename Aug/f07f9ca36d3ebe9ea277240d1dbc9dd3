The Chronicle Harare Bureau FORMER Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa says the life ban imposed on him by the new association’s leadership “is a joke,’’ which will be dismissed by those who make pronouncements that matter in this game, including Fifa and Caf. He claims the current Zifa leadership has been trying to run away from his shadow but will have to live with the reality he now works at a higher level, as the Cosafa president, than leading a national football organisation. “This is a joke and it’ll remain a joke and people here want winners, they don’t want losers,’’ said Chiyangwa. “Cosafa is the regional body and you cannot have people in Zifa mooting sanctions against a superior authority, as has happened. “What worries me, and what the real football power will take care of, are the unsubstantiated claims, where people can make things out of the blue, saying this guy was doing this and that. “What I can assure you is that a comprehensive response is coming and when that happens, I am sure those who are making all these accusations and statements will still be in office to actually stand to answer and defend themselves. “In football, you don’t just sit in a room and come up with lies and say this and that and issue a statement. We are in a different world of the game now and you can even see that the game has now adopted the use of technology so that we can be sure a goal has been scored or a foul has been committed to warrant a penalty”. “The message from that is that football is turning away from lies, from people who try to con the referees to win a penalty”.
