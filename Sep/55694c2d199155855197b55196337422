Chiefs won the match 2-0 Chiefs are wary of Yadah, a side that they have never beaten in three meetings, with the best result being a 2-2 draw in Harare. The other two meetings saw Yadah emerging 1-0 and 3-2 victors in Bulawayo. Chiefs are on 18 points from 21 games and are targeting maximum points. “It won’t be an easy game seeing that we’re both at the tail end and surviving relegation is both teams’ expectations. “History doesn’t favour us against Yadah, so I think we’re comfortable with being underdogs. “Hopefully, we will be able to get a win because time is running out and every game is important for us to secure maximum points,” said Thulani Sibanda, the Chiefs’ coach. Chiefs’ defenders should be on the lookout for seasoned striker, Ralph Matema and slippery winger, Leeroy Mavhunga. Fixtures Today:
