The Chronicle Tobias Mandoreba in Hwange Hwange  2 – 0 Yadah CASTLE Lager Premier League returnees Hwange sent out a bold statement that they are back for business after dismantling Yadah at the Colliery Stadium yesterday. Midfielder Shepherd Gadzikwa’s 35th minute stinging shot and veteran striker Gilbert Zulu’s coolly converted penalty in the 67th minute gave the coal miners the start they wanted in the topflight. Yadah must count themselves lucky not to have suffered a heavier defeat in the Hwange heat as the hosts had two goals disallowed for offside. Yadah flattered only to deceive, with some purposeful play in the opening 20 minutes directed by their best player on display Leeroy Mavhunga, but the final pass let them down. Hwange then slowly got into the game and hardworking anchorman Andrew Chuma shook his head in disbelief when his well struck volley grazed the cross bar with Yadah goalkeeper Bhekimpilo Nyoni a beaten man in the 22nd minute. Striker Ernest Gwitima thought he had drawn first blood for the home side in the 32nd minute, but first assistant referee Oscar Bumhe flagged him for offside. Gadzikwa then struck the opener with a left footer three minutes later to put Hwange ahead. Yadah could have drawn parity on the stroke of halftime when Enock Kwaramba unleashed a scorcher that, however, was acrobatically tipped over the bar by goalkeeper Taimon Mvula. Gwitima was to be denied another goal five minutes after the break for offside before veteran Zulu converted a penalty in the 67th minute to seal Yadah’s fate. Hwange coach Nation Dube paid tribute to defender Felix Chindungwe, who featured for the coal miners despite bereavement in the family. “I am happy for the boys, although there is still a lot of work. Credit to Felix for the sterling work in defence despite losing his father yesterday (Saturday). It shows mental strength,” said Dube. Yadah coach Genesis Mangombe conceded defeat and hoped to recover in their second match. — @tobymandox
