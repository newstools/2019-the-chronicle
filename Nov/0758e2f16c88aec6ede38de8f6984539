The Chronicle Nomvelo Siziba, Chronicle Reporter A TAXI driver in Victoria Falls will live to rue the day he decided to steal a phone from his friend to settle a debt after he was sentenced to eight months in prison.
Kelvin Robert (21) of 4144 Chinotimba suburb borrowed a Mobicel cellphone from Ms Cynthia Dube (19) on the pretext that he wanted to make some calls but did not return it. He handed the phone to Mr Charles Ngombe as payment for US$15 worth of fuel he had borrowed from him.
Robert pleaded guilty to theft when he appeared before Victoria Falls magistrate Ms Rangarirai Gakanje yesterday. The magistrate sentenced him to eight months in prison.
Robert will serve an effective four months in prison after the magistrate suspended four months for five years on condition that he does not, within that period, commit a similar offence. For the State, Mr Japhinos Tavengwa said Robert borrowed a phone from Ms Dube and used it to settle a debt. “On the 30th of August 2019, Robert went to the residence of Ms Dube where he borrowed a phone for temporary use and promised to bring it back later that day. He did not return with the phone. The following day the complainant went to Robert’s place of residence to collect her phone but could not get it as Robert failed to produce it,” said Mr Tavengwa.
The court was told that Robert started making excuses and Ms Dube reported the matter to the police. – @nomvelosiziba.
