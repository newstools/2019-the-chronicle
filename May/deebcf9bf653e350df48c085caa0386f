The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent SOUTH Africa-based comedian Q Dube, who is nominated for the Bulawayo Arts Awards, says there is no feeling that can compare to being recognised in his hometown. Q Dube is nominated in the Outstanding Comedian category alongside ventriloquist Chik Aljoy and MaForty. The Nama award-winning comedian, who relocated to South Africa in January last year, said: “I feel absolutely amazing as I’m being recognised for my craft back home. I’ve been almost everywhere in the world trying to make people laugh and have received humbling reviews in most places, but it still doesn’t compare to the love you receive from home.” Turning to his stint in South Africa, Q Dube, who has performed alongside Celeste Ntuli, Loyiso Gola, Trevor Gumbi and Skhumba, said he is learning new things every day. “Performing in South Africa has been an eye opener. I’m on stage almost every day and that grows and challenges you as a comic. The most memorable performance thus far was the Black Only Comedy show hosted by David Kau where I performed in front of 3 000 people. It was magical.” He said the comedy scene in South Africa is vibrant with competition to outwit other jesters very high. “I’ve been meeting so many comedians who have different techniques and styles to the craft. This has been keeping me on my toes and forcing me to be creative in order to outwit others so that I can stand out,” said Q Dube.
