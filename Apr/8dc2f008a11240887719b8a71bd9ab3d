The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter KNOX Mutizwa’s late penalty was not enough to save Golden Arrows the embarassment of being ejected from the lucrative Nedbank Cup by National First Division side TX Galaxy in the semi-finals on Saturday. On a day in which another Warriors star player Teenage Hadebe returned to the field for Kaizer Chiefs after a near horrific injury, Mutizwa stuck in the 71st minute with a well taken spot kick, but their opponents kept their nerves and managed to force the game into extra time with a last minute equaliser through an own goal by Abafana Besthende’s Sandile Zuke. Zakhele Lepasa struck twice in extra time to knock out Golden Arrows 3-1. Galaxy will now face Kaizer Chiefs, who were 4-2 winners over Chippa United on the same day. Hadebe was stretchered off the field a few weeks ago after suffering a concussion during a league match against Baroka United. The return of Hadebe will be good news for the Warriors’ technical bench, as the Total African Cup of Nations draws closer. Even though Sunday Chidzambwa and his lieutenants are yet to name their final travelling squad, Hadebe is one of the players guaranteed a flight to Egypt where the Warriors are in Group A alongside Uganda, DR Congo and hosts Egypt. The Warriors will get their campaign underway against Egypt on June 21 before taking on Uganda on June 26 and round off their group matches with a clash against the DRC four days later.
