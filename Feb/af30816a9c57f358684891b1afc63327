THE Zimbabwe International Trade Fair company has invited sports organisations through the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, to exhibit at this year’s edition of the trade fair set for April 23 to 27 in Bulawayo. In a circular to National Sports Associations’ presidents, secretary generals and chief executive officers, the Sports and Recreation Commission’s director general, Prince Mupazviriho, said the move for the sports sector to be part of the trade fair was in line with the Government’s thrust that the sports and recreation sector must adopt modern business practices that result in the sector contributing towards national economic development and Gross Domestic Product in line with President Mnangagwa’s Vision 2030. “The ZITF is an annual expo which provides a convenient trade hub for the region and welcomes both trade and public visitors. Against this background it is therefore strategic for sport and recreation sector players at all levels to take advantage of this opportunity and expose their programmes, products and services to potential investors who will patronise the ZITF,” wrote the director general. According to the circular, each exhibitor is expected to take up a minimum of nine square metres. “A consolidated and detailed information will then be submitted to the Ministry at a report back meeting on February 19,” wrote Mupazviriho. Zifa, the Premier Soccer League, Highlanders, FC Platinum, Ngezi Platinum are some of the sporting organisations that have previously exhibited at the Fair. The 2019 edition of ZITF will be the 60th consecutive edition and will be running under the theme “Propagating Industrial Growth through Trade and Investment.”
