The Chronicle Kudzai Chikiwa, Chronicle Reporter POLICE are appealing to members of the public who may have lost property to robbers to go to Bulawayo Central Police Station to identify recovered goods. A suspect Adonia Mashonga (32), who allegedly fingered Zimdancehall chanter Njanji – real name Noah Wambe – and six others in an armed robbery ring, was arrested recently in the city. Bulawayo deputy police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube said Mashonga was arrested at Chicken Inn Drive Through, Bradfield in the city. “Police recovered a 51 inch Samsung curve colour TV with a serial number, a 2 inch Led flat screen TV set, a 32 inch Samsung plasma TV set, a Dell CPU and a Bang monitor and we call upon members of the public to come and identify their property,” he said. Insp Ncube said Mashonga was found in possession of house breaking implements. “The accused was found with a claw hammer, big screw driver, zinc cutter and a long rope which he uses to drop into rooms after cutting open the roof,” he said. Insp Ncube said Mashonga was targeting houses in Bulawayo’s western suburbs. “The robberies occurred between November 2018 and this month when he was arrested,” he said. —@tamary98.
