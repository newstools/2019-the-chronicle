The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma RHUMBA musician, Themba “Boyoyo” Mathe, will be celebrating his 45th birthday and music career on Friday at Mthwakazi Grand Hall, a few kilometres outside Bulawayo along Matopos Road. The celebrations are being organised by fellow rhumba musician Madlela Skhobokhobo to honour the legend who has played a pivotal role in uplifting the country’s music. To spice up the celebrations, the two, who recently collaborated to produce the track titled Celebrate, will perform it for the first time on Friday. Boyoyo, who popularised Kalanga music during national music shows such as galas through his manager Davy Dube, said he was humbled by Madlela’s gesture and is looking forward to the celebrations. “On May 15, I’ll be celebrating my 45th birthday. Who would have thought that two decades later I’d be here, surrounded by those who look up to me. “I’m humbled by the gesture from the younger generation and all artistes who’ll make this day possible,” he said. Boyoyo said he would love to see other artistes who have done well also being honoured. “It’s my wish to see other arts legends being given the honour by their counterparts to appreciate the role they have played in the industry,” he said. – @mthabisi_mthire
