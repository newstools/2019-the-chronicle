The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent A GROUP of five men reportedly ambushed a Filabusi couple and threatened the man who fled from the scene before one gang member raped the woman. Kennedy Wonder Ndlovu (23) of Marumba B Village in Filabusi was not asked to plead when he appeared briefly before Gwanda magistrate, Miss Lerato Nyathi, facing a rape charge. He was remanded in custody to September 9 for trial. Prosecuting, Miss Ethel Mahachi said Ndlovu raped the woman on February 13 at around 3AM while she was on her way from a nightclub with her boyfriend. “On 13 February at around 3AM, the complainant and her boyfriend left Sibiya Nightclub at Theleka Business Centre in Filabusi where they had been drinking and proceeded home. “After they had walked a distance of about 500 metres from the nightclub, they were approached by a group of five men who were flashing torches and Ndlovu was among them. “Ndlovu produced a catapult and threatened to assault the complainant’s boyfriend who fled from the scene leaving his girlfriend behind. Ndlovu dragged the complainant into the bush for a distance of about 100 metres while his friends followed,’’ he said. Ms Mahachi said Ndlovu pulled the complainant into a disused mine about five metres deep and raped her while his friends watched. She said when he was done, Ndlovu and his friends left and he left his catapult and a black hat at the scene. Miss Mahachi said the complainant went back to the business centre where she sought assistance and the matter was reported to the police. The police attended the scene and recovered Ndlovu’s belongings. She said Ndlovu, who was on the run, was arrested on July 10.—@DubeMatutuEnds
