The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter AFTER spending over two months on the sidelines because of injury, Highlanders’ right-back McClive Phiri has resumed training with the first team. The fullback fractured his right humerus, the bone between the elbow and shoulder, during a league encounter against Herentals at Barbourfields Stadium on May 19. Phiri crashed against the pole after being pushed by Herentals midfielder Tinotenda Benza and was taken straight to hospital after being attended to by team medics. Highlanders’ coach Mandla Mpofu said Phiri had resumed training and is in high spirits. “We are pleased to have him back with the squad. He still has two to three weeks before he can take to the field competitively, but he is showing great recovery signs.” Phiri’s injury coincided with that of right-back, Bukhosi Ncube, who is still injured and out for the season. Former national Under-20 captain Andrew Mbeba has been holding fort at the right side of defence. Charlton Siamalonga has also been drafted to play right-back. Bosso are inactive again this weekend as they have more than three players in the Warriors’ Chan squad. Goalkeeper, Ariel Sibanda, defender Peter Muduwa, midfielder Nqobizitha Masuku and striker Prince Dube are in the Warriors’ 18-man squad that faces Mauritius on Sunday.
