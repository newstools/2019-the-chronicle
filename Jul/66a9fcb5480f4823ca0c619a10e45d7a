The Chronicle Michell Zvanyanya, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera) has dismissed as a hoax, a notice circulating on social media to the effect that fuel prices have increased to slightly above $9 per litre. Responding to emailed questions yesterday, Zera acting chief executive officer, Mr Eddington Mazambani said the public should ignore fake social media messages meant to cause alarm and despondency. “Zera wishes to inform the public that the official fuel price increase is the one which came into effect on 22 July 2019 and had $7,19 and $7,47 for diesel and blend respectively as new prices,” said Mr Mazambani. He said Zera has formal channels that it uses to communicate important information in the energy sector instead of falsehoods peddled on social media platforms. The fake fuel price had created panic among members of the public who were claiming that the new changes would have a knock on effect on prices in general. Zera introduced new fuel prices last Monday which saw petrol selling for $7,47 up from $6,10 while the pump price for diesel jumped from $ 5,84 to $7,19. In effecting the fuel price increase, Mr Mazambani said the adjustments were in line with changes on the international market. “The increases are as a result of the movement in the foreign currency exchange rates and the Free On Board (FOB) price. These are global charges and are beyond our control,” he said. FOB is identified as costs carry components like insurance and places the liability of damage with the seller until delivery. — @michellzvanyanyan2
