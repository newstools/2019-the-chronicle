The Chronicle Chronicle Reporter PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa is expected to meet traditional chiefs from Matabeleland region and the Midlands province at State House in Bulawayo today. The Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services posted a statement on Twitter yesterday announcing the meeting. “His Excellency President @edmnangagwa will meet Chiefs from Matabeleland and Midlands Provinces on Friday 28 June 2019, at State House, Bulawayo,” reads the statement. Today’s meeting comes hot on the heels of a similar engagement which the President had in March with the Matabeleland Collective, a grouping of non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations, community-based organisations, trusts, savings clubs and social movements from Bulawayo, Matabeleland North and Matabeleland South. During the meeting, President Mnangagwa held frank and robust discussions with the groups, stressing the need for national cohesion and collective efforts in taking the country forward. The President later said the meeting was eye-opening regarding issues of neglect that the people in the south and south-western region felt so strongly about. The meeting was instructive as it resulted in the creation of a matrix of implementation of issues raised by the people of Matabeleland. Since coming to power in November 2017, President Mnangagwa has been championing the issue of devolution and national healing, among others to ensure national development.
