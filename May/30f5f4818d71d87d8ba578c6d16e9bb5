The Chronicle Esinathy Sibanda, Chronicle Reporter POLICE in Lupane District have banned the carrying of dangerous weapons citing an increase in violence cases in the area. The ban will be effective for three months from tomorrow to August 9. The police said violence cases such as murder, assaults and malicious damage to property have forced law enforcement agents to invoke provisions of the Public Order Security Act (POSA) which empowers them to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons. In a statement, the Officer Commanding Lupane District, Chief Superintendent Edgar Dhliwayo, said they have issued a prohibition order effective for three months. “Police Lupane District is banning the carrying of dangerous weapons due to increased cases of violence where such weapons are being used to inflict injuries on other persons. These assaults have ultimately led to an increase in murder cases,” he said. “The impending unanticipated acts of violence by unruly elements have forced this office to invoke the Public Order and Security Act which allows us to prohibit the carrying of dangerous weapons. Such acts involve the element of violence such as murder, assaults and malicious damage to property’.’ Chief Supt Dhliwayo said the banned weapons include catapults, machetes, axes, knobkerries, swords, knives and daggers. “In terms of section 14(4) of the Public Order and Security Act (11:17), any person failing to comply with such a prohibition order made under subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding level five or imprisonment,” he said. —@esinathy_essira
