No sane person would dispute this judgment. It was everywhere on social media videos and so forth. What we just await for is the sentencing of the kingpin of Zidera. — @Eish. Good news merchants of chaos must be locked up. — @Chihota. We needed a deterrent sentence to stop the likes of Biti from continuing to politicise our elections in the future. A fine is too lenient! — @Charitymaodza. He should face it, a noise maker nothing at all.Biti must go. — @Sherpadmandaza. These guys were busy munching donor money. — @Mug2155. Let him carry his cross. He thinks Zimbabwe is a lawless country. Should have been jailed long back for begging US sanctions. — @JMarange. Response to “Gloves off for merchants of violence”
