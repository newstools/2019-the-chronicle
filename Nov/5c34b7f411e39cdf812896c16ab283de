The meeting is one of the events that have been scheduled for the National Cyber Security Awareness month that ran from Tuesday, first of October to Thursday, 31 October 2019 under the theme “safe surfing”. The key objectives of the national cyber security month are to promote online security and safety, cultivate a cybersecurity culture amongst internet stakeholders and to unlock new opportunities for cyber security collaboration and information. Cyber security has over the years become a serious concern among countries and businesses as the globe forges ahead with industrialisation that inevitably will see the rise in the use of the cyberspace to conduct business. Top of the list of the concerns is the rising trend of cyber terrorism that has targeted Internet networks with a view to either sabotaging services or targeting individuals. — @pridesinstinctz
