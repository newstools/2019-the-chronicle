THE National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), organisers of the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama), yesterday unveiled the nominees for the 18th edition whose awards ceremony has been slated for March 23 at the HICC. Embracing new technologies, the nominees were unveiled during a Facebook Live stream on the NACZ Nama page and the list, like the nominees presentation by MisRed, was quite refreshing as it mostly has new kids on the block. Fast-rising songbird, Tammy Moyo, gospel musician Janet Manyowa as well as Zimdancehall artistes Enzo Ishall and Jah Signal who undisputedly changed the game last year with their music, managed to outshine the likes of Jah Prayzah and Winky D by filling slots in which these two are usually nominated in — (outstanding song, outstanding album and outstanding musician categories). <img class=" wp-image-418494" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Jah-Signal-360x217.jpg" alt="" width="582" height="351" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Jah-Signal-360x217.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/10/Jah-Signal.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px" /> Jah Signal Videographers, Vusa Blaqs and Andy Cutta who are both from Bulawayo and have been behind many artistes’ quality videos, proved that they are the best in the country as three of their music videos are up against each other in the outstanding video category. Also nominated from Bulawayo are a couple of artistes who include Sandra Ndebele, Maforty, Clemence Magwaza, Jeys Marabini, Cedric Msongelwa, Ronald Sigeca, Babongile Sikhonjwa and Likhwa Ncube. <img class=" wp-image-425534" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Enzo-Ishal..-360x185.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="296" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Enzo-Ishal..-360x185.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Enzo-Ishal...jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /> Enzo Ishall Commenting on the nominees, the chairperson of the Nama adjudication panel, Ruby Magosvongwe, hailed the artistes for their level of originality and innovation. “There was a high level of improvement in the quality of the films submitted. It was also noted that artistes are embracing the use of new technology, a development which was noted in the number of entries submitted.” <img class=" wp-image-434099" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/sandra-ndebele-680x380-360x201.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="328" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/sandra-ndebele-680x380-360x200.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/sandra-ndebele-680x380.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /> Sandra Ndebele She also highlighted shortcomings in the presentations of some submissions. “For instance, some photographs of sculptures were not clear with obstructions in their backgrounds. In the film and TV category, formatting and labelling of entries was not well done,” Magosvongwe said. Below is a full list of the Nama 2018 nominees: 1 SPOKEN WORD AWARDS Outstanding Poet
