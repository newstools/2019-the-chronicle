Early this year Sharp competed and came 16th out of 45 riders at the Sonora Rally in Mexico in his bid to qualify for the Saudi Arabia tournament next year 2020. “During your participation at Afriqua Merzouga Rally in 2019, you raced the entire route. So you confirmed your level and proved that you have the skills and qualities required.

Our dreams come true if we have the courage to pursue them,” he wrote on his Facebook post. He will start this epic event that he is calling ‘My Dakar Safari’ on early next year in Saudi Arabia.
