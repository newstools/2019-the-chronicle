The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter WARRIORS’ central defender Teenage Hadebe suffered a concussion after a collision with the upright in an attempt to score for his South African side Kaizer Chiefs in a league match they lost 0-1 to Baroka FC on Saturday evening. There was serious concern from his teammates and Zimbabweans when the former Chicken Inn and Highlanders’ defender remained motionless on the ground after landing akwardly and colliding with the upright. He was stretchered off and immediately taken to hospital as a precaution. There was growing fear that Hadebe’s Total Africa Cup of Nations dream could be over following that injury, but the defender later assured the nation that he will be fine for the finals that will be hosted by Egypt in June. “I will be back stronger,” declared Hadebe. It was a forgettable night for Amakhosi as they were stunned 1-0 by the visitors, who had goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze in top form. Also in the starting line-up was reigning Zimbabwean Soccer Star of the Year and former FC Platinum midfielder Rodwell Chinyengetere. The loss means Chiefs remained rooted seventh on the table with 36 points and are now all but out of the running for the league title. Warriors’ talisman Khama Billiat also missed the clash for Chiefs after failing a late fitness test.
