The Chronicle Leonard Ncube in Victoria Falls HWANGE Diggers Rugby Club played two international friendly matches against Livingstone Rhinos in Zambia on Saturday in an attempt to revive the game in the coal mining town. The club sent two ladies’ and men’s sides to the Zambian border town where both sides emerged victorious. Hwange Diggers ladies whitewashed their hosts 30-0, while the men clinched a cliffhanger encounter 29-28. Hwange Diggers coach Octavia Munhamo-Chikukura said the trip to Zambia was an eye opener. “This was an invitational friendly because we needed game time. Bulawayo is too far for us to travel for a friendly since we are a community club and Victoria Falls, which is closer to us is not in a position to play. That’s why we travelled to Zambia,” said Munhamo-Chikukura. Victoria Falls currently has no competitive rugby. Munhamo-Chikukura said players and officials contributed transport costs and food because of the love of the game. She appealed to the corporate world to help sponsor the team. Hwange Diggers’ ladies last played a competitive match at an invitational tournament in Gweru in October 2018, while the men’s side was last active in August 2018. “We’re trying to revitalise the club. While the sport is there at school level, we need sponsorship for the club so that we can play in the national league. Our trip to Zambia went well, but we’re desperately looking for sponsors so that we can play more games. We have a team of young players that gives us a bright future, but all this may go down the drain if we don’t get sponsors,” Munhamo-Chikukura said. Since the Kwese Rugby Sevens Tournament was moved to Harare, hope for the Hwange club to play in a competitive competition is dwindling with each passing day.
