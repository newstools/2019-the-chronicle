The Chronicle Sikhumbuzo Moyo, Senior Sports Reporter HIGHLANDERS have given their coaches a three game ultimatum to collect a minimum of six points or face the sack. The ultimatum begins with today’s encounter against Triangle United at Gibbo Stadium. After today’s match, Highlanders will take on Mushowani at Barbourfields Stadium before travelling for a tricky away fixture to Hwange. <img class="wp-image-416228 size-article-featured-image" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/bekithemba-super-ndlovu-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/bekithemba-super-ndlovu-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/09/bekithemba-super-ndlovu-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bekithemba Ndlovu “The executive has cracked the whip, if the coaches fail to meet the set target, sadly, they will go, all of them not just the head coach,” said a well-placed source. Highlanders are hovering in the murky waters of relegation following their back to back losses to Caps United where they lost 1-2 away and a 0-1 home loss to Harare City on Sunday. <img class="wp-image-437335 size-article-featured-image" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Tembo-Chuma-680x380.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Tembo-Chuma-680x380.jpg 680w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/02/Tembo-Chuma-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Tembo Chuma The team’s technical bench is led by Mandla Lulu Mpofu assisted by Bekithemba Super Ndlovu while the goalkeepers coach is Tembo Chuma.
