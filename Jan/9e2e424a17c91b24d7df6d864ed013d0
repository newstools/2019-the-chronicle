BULAWAYO basketball fans will have to wait for another week as there won’t be any action in the Bulawayo Basketball League this weekend due to clubs’ failure to train during the week following disturbances. The basketball league resumed last week at Khanyisile Sports Centre in North End following the festive season break. Bulawayo Basketball Association (BBA) promotions and marketing officer Francis Dube said it is sad that they won’t be able to go ahead with the games as planned. “It’s a setback for the league as we’ll be a week behind. The teams couldn’t prepare well for the games, but all is set for the games to resume the following weekend at Khanyisile Sports Centre,” said Dube. The delay also means the Bulawayo Basketball League will be two weeks behind their Harare counterparts and Dube said it’s not what they wanted. “The second round of games is so important as the team topping the log gets to represent the province in the National Championships,” he said.
