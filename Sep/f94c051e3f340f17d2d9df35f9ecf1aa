The Chronicle Courtney Matende, Midlands Reporter THE Government yesterday donated 20 bales of clothes and more than 100 bags of rice to assist the less-privileged in rehabilitation centres in Gweru. Deputy Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, Cde Lovemore Matuke handed over the donations to Queen of Peace children’s home, Rutendo Heart children’s home, Midlands children’s home, Batanai old people’s home, and Blue Hills Probation and Remand home. Each of these homes received four bales of clothes and rice according to the number of beneficiaries. Cde Matuke said the donation was in line with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s promise that no one is going to die of hunger. “President Mnangagwa has said no one will die of hunger and we are here to donate rice and clothes to the rehabilitation centres in Gweru. Each home is being given four bales of clothes and the rice is being distributed according to the number of people at an individual home,” he said. Cde Matuke encouraged matrons and caregivers from the different homes to carry on with their good work in looking after the needy people. “Being responsible for the needy is not an easy task; I therefore encourage all of you to keep on doing the amazing work you do. Such responsibility can only be a calling from God,” he said. Founder of Queen of Peace children’s home, Mrs Stella Khumalo said they are responsible for the mentally challenged children and they rarely receive visitors due to stigmatisation. “We look after mentally handicapped children and some of the children come pregnant so we take care of both mothers and children. Due to stigmatisation we receive very few visitors and donations. The children need to go school. On a positive note we got a farm from His Excellency and we are grateful,” she said.
