The Chronicle Stanford Chiwanga, Chronicle Reporter THE Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, Cde Raj Modi, has pledged to construct a classroom block for Muchadziya Primary School, a satellite school in ward 23, Muchadziya area in Chimanimani. The Zanu-PF Bulawayo South legislator made the undertaking at a meeting with villagers that had gathered at Dzingire Primary School in Kopa for a pre-donation meeting on Sunday afternoon. “I have been talking to Macdonald Bricks and we reached an agreement that they will supply me with bricks to build a classroom block in an area of my choice. I have chosen Muchadziya Primary School after learning that the school lacks basic infrastructure such as classrooms. “In two weeks’ time if all is in place and it should be, I will come back here with bricks and cement to build the classroom block. This school is yours so I hope the skills and labour that will be used to construct the classroom block will be from Muchadziya area,” said Cde Modi. Addressing the same gathering of about 3000 people, Zanu-PF Chimanimani East legislator, Cde Joshua Sacco, said the classroom will provide an inviting, safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for pupils. Cde Sacco said: “While the Honourable Deputy Minister will provide the bricks and cement,I will source the required timber. I expect the local community to also contribute towards the construction of the classroom block. You can provide labour, you can fetch water or sand. We all have a part to play”.
