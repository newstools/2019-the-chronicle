The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Business Correspondent DELTA Beverages says it will introduce a 660ml Magnum Castle Lite returnable bottle onto the market this Easter. Castle Lite had only a 340ml bottle. According to a statement by Delta Beverages, the introduction of the 660ml Magnum will be done to satisfy customer needs. “This Easter Delta Beverages will be introducing the new Castle Lite Magnum 660ml returnable glass bottle onto the market. This long-awaited pack is an exciting introduction to the market as we seek to meet consumer needs for a large serve pack. As a leader in premium beer, Castle Lite remains the brand that consumers can expect to bring fresh news and innovation, be it through unique packaging design or engaging brand activations. For this reason, our new 660ml returnable glass bottle will launch with the fresh new packaging design for Castle Lite,” read the statement. Instead of a twist off bottle top, which is synonymous with the 340ml bottle, the Magnum will be a returnable bottle. “We know that our consumers have become accustomed to our one-way 340ml non-returnable glass bottle and cans, therefore we encourage them to familiarise with this new Magnum 660ml returnable bottle, as it carries with it a deposit value to be redeemed in the trade. The bottle will be in uniquely embossed green glass, however, this time with a pry off crown. We encourage all glass to be kept safely to avoid any chips or cracks,” said Delta.
