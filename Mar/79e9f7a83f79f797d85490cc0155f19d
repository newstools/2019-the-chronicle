TOBACCO giant BAT Zimbabwe have refuted social media reports that they have entered into a sponsorship deal with Harare giants Dynamos. There has been growing rumours in the social media circles and even from some sources close to the club that the Harare giants had actually gone to bed with the tobacco company ahead of the start of the 2019 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. “British American Tobacco Zimbabwe does not have a sponsorship agreement with Dynamos Football Club, or any other football team in the country,” said a spokesperson for the company when contacted for comment on the issue. Dynamos chairman Isaiah Mupfurutsa also denied the reports but said his executive was busy talking to a number of potential sponsors including renewing their deal with mobile communications company NetOne. DeMbare rivals Highlanders and Caps United were also bankrolled by NetOne last season and are keen on renewing the relationship with talks said to be at an advanced stage. “That is not correct (that the club has signed a deal with BAT Zimbabwe). However, we are engaging various potential sponsors including NetOne,” said Mupfurutsa, who took over the reins at the Glamour Boys from Kenny Mubaiwa. The Harare giants, who conquered domestic football in consecutive years from 2011 to 2014 under Callisto Pasuwa before being dethroned by Bulawayo’s Chicken Inn under Joe Antipas, had a bumpy 2018 season and were strong relegation candidates for the better part of the year. This year, they have been doing their pre-season business quietly that saw them sign up a number of unheralded players including a Cameroonian Hervé Vincent Mbega.
