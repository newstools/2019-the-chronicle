The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Chronicle Reporter THE Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has bemoaned loss of documents by survivors of Cyclone Idai, saying it will affect their access to important services. In a statement, ZHRC said identity particulars are a vital need that is constitutionally guaranteed. “Many of the survivors are likely to have lost birth certificates, national identity cards, passports and other essential documents necessary to access services and pursue opportunities in life,” read the statement. ZHRC said the disaster caused injuries and suffering to a lot of people and the commission expressed condolences to the bereaved families. The commission said it was encouraged by the commitment to restore normalcy and ensure the protection of human rights in a disaster situation in line with relevant national, regional and international standards. ZHRC lauded the Government for mobilising resources to address the humanitarian disaster. “The President also committed to mobilise resources to address the dire human rights situations and has in fact been directly participating in the rescue and recovery efforts.” In an interview recently, Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) Acting Executive Secretary Mr Erick Mukutiri said lack of documentation results in violation of human rights such as the right to vote, access to social services and right to education. “Lack of access to identity documents results in people failing to vote because they do not have the documents, and some children fail to write examinations because they do not have a birth certificate,” said Mr Mukutiri. @sharonbuwe
