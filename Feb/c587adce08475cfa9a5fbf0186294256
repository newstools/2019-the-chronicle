Bulawayo revellers will be spoilt for choice when South Africa’s Mlindo the Vocalist and Zimdancehall man of the moment Enzo Ishall perform at different venues in the city next Saturday. Mlindo will be at BAC Leisure while Enzo Ishall will be entertaining revellers at Cosmopolitan Night club. The SA singer’s music has gripped Bulawayo music fans with hits such as Amacala, Wamuhle and the ever popular Amablesser. Enzo Ishall is also popular with hits such as Smart, Kanjiva and most recently 50 Magate. One cannot deny that Enzo Ishall is one of the most sought-after artistes in Zimbabwe . <img class=" wp-image-425534" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Enzo-Ishal..-360x185.jpg" alt="" width="592" height="304" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Enzo-Ishal..-360x185.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/11/Enzo-Ishal...jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /> Enzo Ishall The promoters of Enzo’s show are confident they can draw the numbers on a night that a top South African artiste will be in the city. “The vibe at a Zimdancehall show is always extra hyped and you dance yourself to a standstill. If one wants to have fun the whole night listening to predominantly Zimdancehall hits then this will be the right place to be,” said Enzo’s event organiser, Terminator Makoni. He said to spice up the event, they had included the rump shaking 50 Magate video vixen, Kikky BadA$$ on the lineup. To also ensure they lure Zimdancehall crowds and counter Enzo’s gig, Mlindo organisers have roped in top reggae/dancehall DJs – Judgement Yard. The duo of chanter Etherton and DJ Flevah are not new to the Bulawayo crowd and know how to drive the crowds into frenzy with their selection of dancehall and reggae music.
