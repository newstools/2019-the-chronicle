President Mnangagwa’s Second Republic is committed to putting great effort in the promotion of literature and the arts as they are the soul of the nation, a Cabinet Minister has said. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Cde Monica Mutsvangwa made the remarks when she officiated at the memorial service of the late great writer Dr Charles Mungoshi at the Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour in Chitungwiza yesterday. “Nothing is as rich as the written word and due to the lack of it, a lot of Africa’s heritage and diversity got lost,” she said. Minister Mutsvangwa noted the death of Dr Mungoshi who was a reverred literary giant over a time-span of half a century was a sad loss to Zimbabwe. “Being an outstanding writer, many of his books became set books studied in schools in English and Shona and he also proved to be a versatile writer such that today we mourn a remarkable artist and thinker. “Mungoshi took the African tradition of folk-telling around the fire-place to print and other media and in Zimbabwe he leaves a very rich heritage for the contemporaries, current and future generations,” she said. She paid tribute to Mungoshi’s widow, Jesesi, for the bravery she showed over the years and being able to stand by an ailing husband for a very long time, urging her to use the experience to educate other women in similar situations. Minister Mutsvangwa, her husband, Ambassador Chris Mutsvangwa and permanent secretary in the Ministry Cde Nick Mangwana donated foodstuffs for the funeral while ZBC CEO Patrick Mavura pledged to provide the family with breakfast and lunch today.
