The Chronicle Mthabisi Tshuma RHUMBA musician, Clement Magwaza, is hopeful of clinching his first National Arts Merit Award (Nama) at this year’s edition taking place in Harare next month. The Kokotsha Makokotsha hit-maker feels he has what it takes to win the Song of the Year gong where his Khal’uphethe is up against Jah Signal’s Sweetie, Enzo Ishall’s Kanjiva and Obert Chari’s Mebo. His nomination at the Namas, Magwaza says, has motivated him to get back to studio and work on a production that will uplift his brand regionally. “This is my first Nama nomination and it shows that I’m in the right direction. This year, I’m putting more pressure and energy in my productions so that I grow my name in the industry. “I’m already working on something that’ll definitely uplift my status in the country and abroad,” said Magwaza. The talented Plumtree-born singer said with nine albums under his belt and being in the music sector for two decades, the long drought in the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ)-sponsored awards should be a thing of the past as he has widened his scope with shows lined up for neighbouring South Africa. “Over the weekend, I was in Polokwane, South Africa where I was invited to perform by a family who had been scouting for me for over four years now. It was nice to see how Zimbabwean music is being appreciated in other countries. “Being in the game for 20 years now, it’s an honour to see how my music is growing.” – @mthabisi_mthire.
