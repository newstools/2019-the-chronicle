Yesterday’s win saw Zimbabwe make up for losing to Uganda in the final of the same tournament in 2017 where they went down by three wickets to the East Africans in Namibia. An excited Lady Chevrons captain Mary-Anne Musonda spoke of how eager they were to get over the pain of losing to Uganda two years ago. “I am really happy, coming from 2017 when we lost, it was very painful; people cried and it was very emotional for the whole team. Coming here we knew that we had to work on every single aspect of the game and also the mental aspect of saying we have won all the games against weaker teams probably and not let complacency kick in,” Musonda said. “Definitely all we need is more game time; the more games we play the more positive we will be, the more we will also understand ourselves and the more we will also try different plans and strategies. All we are asking for are more games, game time is what’s going to get us through,” she said. Musonda expressed her appreciation to the World Cup headed Zimbabwe national netball team who came to support their cricket counterparts. “It was very important for them to be supporting us and as women in sports in Zimbabwe, we always want to be together. For them to be here the girls are really happy, we are going to support each other, we hope that one day all the women sports in Zimbabwe are going to be in the top tier in the world.” Coach Adam Chifo was thrilled that his team had secured a ticket to Scotland with the months of fine tuning paying off. “We are more than excited to have qualified. We have been preparing for this for a long time, mentally, physically and tactically so I am happy it came out right,” said Chifo. The Lady Chevrons will tour Ireland in July before heading to Netherlands as they prepare for the Global Qualifier where the top two teams will proceed to next year’s ICC Twenty20 World Cup in Australia. — @Mdawini_29
