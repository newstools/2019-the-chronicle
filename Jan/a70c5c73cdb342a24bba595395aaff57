THE National Darts Association of Zimbabwe (Ndaz) will hold the Champion of Champions darts competition at Munyati Power Station on February 2 in preparation for the 2019 season which will start in mid-February. Ndaz president Meynard Moyo said the competition will see 20 teams taking part representing two teams per each of the country’s 10 provinces. Bulawayo Metropolitan Darts Association will be represented by Archers and Raylton in the tournament. Moyo said the preparations are at an advanced stage and 14 teams have so far confirmed their participation. “The Champion of Champions competition is a way of coming out with the best team in the country before the season kicks-off and is part of creating a platform for teams in different provinces to interact. “We’re looking forward to a mouthwatering event as teams will give their all to come out victorious,” said Moyo. He said the tournament will also play a major role in the preparation for the 2019 season which will start simultaneously in all provinces. “The committee is busy working around the clock as there are negotiations to ensure that the winners will play in a regional tournament but there is nothing tangible at the moment. Actually the games will be a season opener,” Moyo said. — @DecoDecent2
