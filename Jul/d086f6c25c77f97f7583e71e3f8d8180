The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zifa Southern Region Division One league goes on a two-week break starting this weekend with only the rescheduled Ajax Hotspurs and Binga Pirates match taking place. The break comes with ambitious Talen Vision on top of the standings, closely followed by Bulawayo City who were given a rude awakening by Makomo 0-3 last weekend. The turn of the half is going to be an exciting one with teams at the top hoping to cling on to their positions while the bottom of the table sides are coming out to fight for their survival, making every league encounter exciting. Talen Vision have amassed 30 points from 14 games while City have collected 29 points from as many games. The point difference shows how tight the race for promotion has been. Talen Vision are yet to taste defeat in this campaign while City’s reality check defeat was their first and only loss. City’s mission to make a quick return to the topflight has hit a break wall in recent weeks with the former premiership side failing to win in their last three encounters. ZPC Hwange sit on third place, five points away from the top. Having had a decent first half of the season they will fancy their chances to cause an upset. Casmyn are bottom of the table with 10 points from 13 games, but chances of survival are very high given that they are just two points away from safety. The battle at the bottom is as tight as it is at the top.  Relegation candidates, Ajax, Mainline, Mosi Rovers, Arenel and Toronto will all be hoping for better fortunes when they return to action in a fortnight. — @innocentskizoe
