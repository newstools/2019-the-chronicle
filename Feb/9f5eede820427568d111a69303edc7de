HIGHLANDERS Legends put up a polished performance to brew a shocker by pipping defending champions Giants 63-61 in the Bulawayo Basketball League on Sunday at Khanyisile Sports Club. Legends’ win has blown the title race wide open, leaving them and Giants and Mavericks with a chance to win the title. Legends’ utility player Jordan Davies gave credit to his teammates for defying the odds to beat their more fancied opponents to give them a good fighting chance for the championship. “After the win over Giants we’ve shown that we might have our chance to pose a shocker and come supreme at the end of the season. “We started as a social team since we didn’t have enough time to practice together on a daily basis, but we are now in a position of taking on any team as shown by our level of competition lately. “We just had a new coach and every player is determined to show what they’re capable of and I can simply say the spirit among us as players is high and we’re raring to go,” said Davies. Log leaders Mavericks beat Nust B 70-44 to maintain pole position. In the ladies’ category, Nust added more misery to Divas, who haven’t won a single match since the start of the season. Nust were awarded a 20-0 walkover after Divas failed to turn up for the fixture. Tracey Phiri, one of the Divas’ senior players, said the team suffered a lot of injuries and some players are out with various degrees of injuries. “We failed to commit to our last fixture due to the fact that the majority of our players are school going, so some of them find it hard to attend evening games. “We integrated a number of youngsters that are slowly gaining experience and we’re optimistic that come next season there will be a foundation to build from,” said Phiri.
