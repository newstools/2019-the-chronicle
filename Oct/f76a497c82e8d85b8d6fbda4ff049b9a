The Chronicle Munyaradzi Musiiwa, Midlands Correspondent SUSPENDED Gweru City Council Town Clerk, Ms Elizabeth Gwatipedza who is facing negligence of duty, incompetence and mismanagement charges appeared before a disciplinary hearing yesterday. The local authority appointed Mr Melusi Moyo of Dube-Banda, Nzarayapenga legal practitioners to preside over the disciplinary hearing. Ms Gwatipedza, through her lawyer Mr Valentine Mutatu of Mutatu and partners legal practitioners, challenged the validity of her suspension. The legal team also challenged Mr Moyo’s appointment, saying it was not done by a duly constituted special council meeting. Ms Gwatipedza’s lawyers also said the acting Town Clerk, Mr Vakayi Chikwekwe and Mayor Councillor Josiah Makombe, could have been involved in the appointment of Mr Moyo yet they are witnesses in the matter. The legal team also argued that Clr Makombe did not append his signature on the suspension letter but it was signed on his behalf by one of the councillors hence the suspension was not procedural. In an interview, Mr Mutatu confirmed that Ms Gwatipedza appeared before the disciplinary hearing. “Ms Gwatipedza appeared before the disciplinary hearing but we however challenged the validity of the suspension as well as the composition of the disciplinary authority. We had issues with the appointing criterion of the disciplinary authority,” he said. Mr Mutatu said the disciplinary authority will today deliver a verdict on whether or not to proceed with the  hearing. Harare lawyer Mr Charles Kwaramba of Mbidzo Muchadehama and Makoni legal practitioners is supposed to  lead the prosecution on behalf of council. Ms Gwatipedza was suspended three weeks ago. Clr Makombe said Ms Gwatipedza faced a number of allegations which includes failure to coordinate, monitor and supervise all departments which affected service delivery. Following the suspension, Mr Chikwekwe was appointed acting Town Clerk.
