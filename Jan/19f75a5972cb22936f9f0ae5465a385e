AT least 600 athletes are expected to attend the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe (Naaz)’s track and field championships to be held at White City Stadium in Bulawayo on Saturday. Runners that post good times, great jumps or throws will have brighter prospects of qualifying for national teams that will compete at regional and international meets in 2019. The White City meet is the second selection event of the year after Naaz held a similar competition in Harare on January 6. “This race is open to all athletes and as it is, athletes from areas like Victoria Falls, Bindura, Mutare, Harare, Gweru, Zvishavane and Bulawayo have confirmed that they will participate in this event. The overwhelming interest is testimony to the fact that athletes know it is by competing at such races that one stands a chance of breaking onto the international scene. Clubs are also welcome to participate at the Naaz track and field championships,” said Manuel Mpofu, the Bulawayo Athletics Board (Bab) chairman. International competitions set for this year include the World Cross Country Championships to be held on March 30 in Denmark, African Junior Championships that runs from April 16-20 in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire, as well as the International Athletics Association Federation (IAAF) World Relays set for Tokyo, Japan, on May 11 and 12. In September and October, selected athletes will participate in Qatar’s World Championships and the All-Africa Games set for Morocco. — @ZililoR
