RUGBY enthusiasts are in for a treat when the Bulawayo Metropolitan Rugby Football Board Under-21 tournament games resume at Hartsfield Ground this afternoon. The pick of today’s games is a repeat of last year’s final pitting defending champions Matabeleland Warriors and 2017 winners Old Miltonians (OMs). Warriors beat OMs 19-14 in last year’s final. Warriors are presently at the top of the league table with 10 points from two games after posting an impressive 56-7 win over Bulldogs and dismissing Highlanders 26-5. Second-placed Oms lost their opening game 15-19 to third-placed Highlanders before going on to beat Bulldogs 23-7. OMs will pin their hopes on Barney Matambo, who scored two tries against Bulldogs, Shepherd Mtheliso, Lyden Gakava and Keith Chirimambowa to lead them against tournament favourites Warriors. The defending champions will bank on Ethan Wilson, Leon Musichili, Hilton Gwekwerere, Sovereign Mwanyenya, Emilio Wilson, Lungile Mafikela, Vuyiswa Mpofu and Takudzwa Sithole, who have been scoring tries for fun in the tournament. Highlanders can displace OMs from second place if they convincingly beat Bulldogs. Bosso will bank on Josiah Gondo, Exalted Tomu, Tinashe Mgijima and Oswell Msimanga, who were instrumental in their 19-15 win over OMs. Fixtures
Today: Highlanders v Bulldogs (2.30pm), Matabeleland Warriors v Old Miltonians (4pm)
