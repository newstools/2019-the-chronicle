STRUCTURAL changes are looming within the Zifa national teams, with new faces expected in the senior and Under-23 men’s sides. Sources said the football motherbody wants to “beef up” technical teams for the Warriors and the Under-23 sides. “Changes are going to be made at tomorrow’s technical meeting, with some members of the senior men and the Under-23 national teams being reassigned. “There is a possibility of seeing new faces coming in. It won’t be wholesome changes because the board doesn’t want to rock the boat but wants to bring stability and strengthen the technical teams,” said a source. There have been reports of Bongani Mafu bouncing back into the senior national team technical set up to assist veteran gaffer Sunday Chidzambwa at the expense of either Rahman Gumbo or Lloyd Mutasa. Tonderai Ndiraya could either move to the senior team as assistant coach or head the Under-23 side. Former Young Warriors coach Mandla Mpofu worked with Ndiraya and Norman Mapeza in the Warriors set-up, being in charge of Zimbabwe’s first 2019 Afcon qualifier against Liberia which they won 3-0 before being chucked out. The sources said the changes at the Warriors and the Under-23 teams were the first before they cascade to lower teams as well as women’s sides. However, Zifa spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela said he is not aware of the looming changes but confirmed that the association’s vice-president Gift Banda, who is responsible for all national teams will have a meeting with the senior national team and Under-23 men’s technical teams. “It’s a meeting between VP and members of technical teams for Senior and U-23 teams. “I have not been briefed on any changes yet,” said Xolisani Gwesela, Zifa spokesperson. — @ZililoR
