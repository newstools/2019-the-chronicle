ZANU-PF Politburo member Cde Perrance Shiri has said the party has no regrets over the recent military intervention in restoring peace following violence perpetrated by malcontents two weeks ago. He said people should revert to constitutional ways of expressing their grievances and refrain from resorting to violence. Addressing a crowd at the commissioning of Guruve Community Information Centre last Friday, Cde Shiri said the army could not sit and watch the country burn after the police force was incapacitated. “There are several ways to express our griviences,” he said. “You can do so through Parliament, Government and peaceful protests. However, we will not tolerate acts of violence, looting and burning of property. This is not how Zimbabweans behave. We do not regret the intervention by the soldiers. If the police is incapacitated we will call the military to put out the fire. Did people want Harare to burn while soldiers watched? We appeal to youths to be disciplined and to appreciate the importance of peace, unity and love.” Cde Shiri urged teachers to continue reporting for duty as their grievances were being addressed.
