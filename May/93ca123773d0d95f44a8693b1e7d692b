The Chronicle Cyclone Fani, the strongest storm to hit the Indian subcontinent in five years, has barrelled into Bangladesh after leaving a trail of deadly destruction across the eastern coast of India. At least 16 people died in India, mostly in the worst-hit state of Odisha, Scott Heidler reported on Saturday, citing local Indian media reports. In neighbouring Bangladesh, authorities said at least 12 people died and scores of others wounded as Fani swung northeastwards into the country. At least four of those deaths were reported from Kishorganj district in central Bangladesh. “They died after they were struck by lightning. There have been heavy rains and storm here since Friday noon,” the district’s Deputy Commissioner Sarwar Murshed Chowdhury said. Over a million people were moved to safety, Bangladeshi officials said, a massive evacuation exercise also followed in India’s Odisha state, where a similar cyclone 20 years ago had killed 10 000 people. – AP
