The Chronicle Sports Reporter AMAVEVANE Social Club will host Izinsizwa at Milton High School today as part of their Independence and Easter holiday football celebrations. The two teams are also members of the famed Golden Oldies Social League, which is presently in its off-season, and today’s match will provide the two teams an opportunity to fine tune their squads ahead of the start of the 2019 season. Besides being part of the city’s social football league, both sides are members and supporters associations of Highlanders FC. Xolani Ndlovu, the Amavevane Social Club secretary, said his club usually holds such matches during such holidays. “These sorts of sporting events bring people together and seeing or participating in them is a special moment for everyone. At such events, there is always a chance to provide a platform for people to socialise and spend the holiday in a safe and entertaining environment,” said Ndlovu. “People either travel or remain at home during the busy holidays and even go as far as drinking alcohol, which mostly leads to accidents and negligence, so our gathering seeks to counter any such misfortunes,” said Ndlovu, who is a former Highlanders team doctor. He said football has the power to bring people together regardless of their age and culture. — @DecoDecent2
