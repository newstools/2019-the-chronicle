The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter Bulawayo City 7-1 Ajax Hotspurs A hattrick by defender Zibusiso Sibanda powered Bulawayo City to the top of the Zifa Southern Region Division One Soccer League as they clobbered Ajax Hotspurs at Luveve Stadium yesterday. City are now on 10 points, one ahead of Talen Vision who take on Indlovu Iyanyathela at Mzilikazi Barracks today. Watched by Bulawayo Mayor Solomon Mguni, City had no mercy for Ajax as they trampled on the Mpopoma-based side with Sibanda giving the local authority bankrolled club the lead in the third minute, heading in a Thembani Masuku corner. Sibanda got his second on the half-hour mark when he timed his run to beat an offside trap and got to the end of a Canaan Nkomo defence splitting pass to coolly slot the ball into the net. The City defender completed his hattrick in the 56th minute from the penalty spot after Masuku had been brought down in the box. Masuku struck a brace for City, scoring a beauty in the 12th minute as he made a run into the box, controlled a cross from Hughe Chikosa before blasting a shot past a hapless Ajax goalkeeper. Masuku completed his brace in the 80th minute heading in a Chikosa cross from the left. Winger Physwell Madhazi was on target for City, tapping in a Chikosa 24th minute pinpoint pass. Chikosa capped a fine afternoon with 90th minute goal. Just as City thought they were going home with a clean sheet, Keith Miti got a consolation goal for Ajax in injury time following a beautiful build-up. Ajax coach Gugu Hadebe said conceding early goals took the steam out of his players. “The mistake we made was conceding three early goals and it just killed the boys’ spirits. I think we panicked and gave City players lots of respect. “However, we had phases where we managed to build from the back, enjoyed possession, but the damage had already been done,” said Hadebe. City assistant coach Golding Dube said: “Dropping two points in Binga forced us to work harder and that is why we wanted to wrap up the game early. “We started at high-tempo in search of two early goals but we were lucky that we got three. “We knew that if we don’t score early they were going to gain confidence and give us problems. I must commend the players for not underestimating our opponents.” Fixtures Today: Nengasha v Main Line (postponed), Toronto v Moto Moto (Mzilikazi Barracks, 3pm), Indlovu Iyanyathela v Talen Vision (Mzilikazi Barracks, 12pm), Casmyn v Arenel Movers (Turk Mine, 3pm), Makomo v Mosi Rovers (Mpumalanga, 12pm), CIWU v Binga Pirates (Crescent, 12pm), Bosso 90 v ZPC Hwange (Crescent, 3pm) Wednesday,
