The Chronicle Tonderai Zvimba, Showbiz Reporter BULAWAYO dance, music and theatre group Khaya Arts will be celebrating their 9th anniversary with a dance production titled Dlala. The hour-long production will be showcased at the Bulawayo Theatre next Saturday with the event expected to kick off at 6PM. Director and founder of the group, Future Dube, said they were excited as this is one of their biggest shows. “It’ll be our first time performing at Bulawayo Theatre. We’ll be celebrating our ninth year together this year and this Dlala music production meant to take the audience on a journey, will be a compilation of all our past dances mixed with new ones,” Dube said. He said their journey as a group had not been an easy one. “Sometimes I ask myself how we’ve managed to come this far and I just thank God because it’s been a very difficult journey. Funding was one of our biggest challenges as some of the members that we started with left for South Africa to seek greener pastures,” he said. After the Bulawayo showing, the Dlala production will be taken to other provinces. “Last year, we bought our own kombi so we’re planning to take the production to different venues in Matabeleland then other provinces as we are on a mission to expand our fan base.”
