The Chronicle Noel Munzabwa in Manzini, Eswatini
ABOUT a week after Rodwell Dhlakama committed his future to Chapungu, the nomadic coach sneaked back into Eswatini on Wednesday to prepare MTN Premier League relegation threatened Matsapha United for today’s EswatiniBank Cup Round of 32 tie against Rail FC. According to sources at Chapungu, Dhlakama is officially on leave until mid-April, meaning he will miss the start of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League, leaving the Gweru outfit coachless. Dhlakama confirmed this arrangement. “I am officially on vacation leave something my bosses back in Zimbabwe are aware of and cleared. I will only be back at Chapungu in April when my leave ends. Yes, I am in Eswatini where I am involved with Matsapha United as part of practicals for a soccer course,” said Dhlakama yesterday. Dhlakama, who has previously had stints with Manzini Sundowns and Green Mamba, seems to have fallen in love with Eswatini football judging by the time he spends in the kingdom during the Zimbabwean Premiership’s off-season. Dhlakama’s absence at Chapungu’s pre-season preparations and first few games of the season could be disastrous for the airmen. Chapungu are currently conducting their pre-season training under Clement Mugari, a non-holder of the mandatory Caf A Licence, and this should worry the club’s fans. — @NoelMunzabwa
