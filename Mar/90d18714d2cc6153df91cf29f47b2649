The Chronicle Showbiz Reporter The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), organisers of the National Arts Merit Awards (Nama) and arts ministry have postponed the awards ceremony as the country is dealing with the effects of Cyclone Idai. This is the second time that the awards – which were meant to take place this weekend – have been postponed after another cancellation last month due to logistical challenges. The awards will now be held on April 13 at the Harare International Conference Centre. “The 18th National Arts Merit Awards date has been moved to 13 April 2019. As the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, together with our parastatal – the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe, we took the decision based on the current national situation of the effects of the natural disaster, Cyclone Idai that has claimed lives and vastly destroyed properties,” said the arts ministry in a statement issued yesterday. Cyclone Idai ravished Manicaland province especially Chimanimani district, with flash floods that have left thousands homeless, hundreds missing and destroying crops in the process. The death toll so far is more than 100. To assist those affected, artistes from around the country pulled together in asking for donations to aid the affected families this week. “As Zimbabweans, our culture is to assist each other in times of need. This is our problem and we have to assist affected families,” said Jah Prayzah who mobilised other artistes to donate foodstuffs and clothes. He yesterday travelled to Chimanimani where he handed over the donations. Power couple, Olinda and Tytan who are in the UK also showed their support by donating boxes of clothes through the Olinda Chapel Foundation. Olinda also collected donations on behalf of other people who are in the UK.
