The Chronicle Response to: Dabengwa is national hero . . . His contribution unquestionable”. The good thing about the new dispensation is that its leaders do not forget their comrades whom they toiled together with in the trenches. I salute the President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Zanu-PF for the stance on Dabengwa. Keep it up. – Mukute. Response to “Zupco fires over 100 conductors”. That’s a great move, they should be fired if they are stealing from the Government. That’s how corruption starts. They should be replaced by others who are willing to work with the Government in a respectful manner. — Taku46. Response to “China denounces US ‘rumours’, ‘lies’”. Just let Trump shoot himself in the foot and America. Now you are seeing the final decline of America Imperialism. Every word that comes from American leadership is fabricated lies. And they know the world knows Trump is a liar. So let him hang himself and his country in the international markets. — Pianki.
