The Chronicle Kudzai Chikiwa, Chronicle Reporter CHURCHES have been called upon to heed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s call for a litter free environment by always cleaning their environment. The President declared the first Friday of each month, the National Environment Cleaning Day as Government moves to ensure the country has sustainable environment management and waste disposal systems. Speaking during a clean-up campaign by the Seventh Day Adventist Church (SDA) at Sokusile Shopping Centre in Nkulumane suburb yesterday, the SDA Nkulumane District Youth Programmer, Mr Nthando Hlabangana said the church should not wait for the National Clean-up Day but should instead make it a habit to clean the city everyday. “The President called for a clean-up day but as a Church we are saying we cannot wait for the first Friday of the month to clean our areas. Even the bible makes it clear that we are there to serve the nation and we are custodians of resources here on earth,” he said. Mr Hlabangana said churches should be practical and do as they preach. “Being a preacher should not end with saying words behind the pulpit but we should demonstrate by doing what we say in our sermons. If we preach health let’s then make our surroundings diseases free,” he said. He commended the Bulawayo City Council for supporting the Church’s initiative to keep the city clean. “We were more than 100 members drawn from six churches and the city council provided the tools that included brooms, refuse bags and spikes,” he said. Mr Hlabangana said one of the local pharmacies donated gloves. – @tamary98
