A MAN from Bulawayo has appeared in court for allegedly stealing wagon leaf springs worth $4 950 from the National Railways of Zimbabwe. Xolani Zulu (27) pleaded guilty to a theft charge when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Mr Tinashe Tashaya who remanded him in custody to Monday for sentence. The court heard how Zulu committed the offence with two accomplices who managed to escape from the Railways yard and are still at large. Prosecuting, Mr Nkathazo Dlodlo said on February 26 this year at around 5PM, four NRZ security guards including Mr Washington Masasi were on patrol at the NRZ yard when they discovered the crime. “They observed two wagon leaf springs hidden in the grass outside the fence. “The four security guards laid an ambush on the same day at around 10PM. They saw three accused persons, one of them was in action taking the hidden wagon leaf springs from the grass,” said Mr Dlodlo. He said when the three realised that the guards had set an ambush, they tried to flee but Mr Masasi managed to apprehend Zulu while his two accomplices escaped. The court heard that when Zulu was arrested the police conducted a search at his house and they recovered 13 wagon leaf springs. The total value of the stolen wagon leaf springs is $4 950 and they were all recovered. The wagon leaf springs are held as exhibits. – @gwizi_n.
