The Chronicle Editor – Reports that Parliament could be pushing for a law that recognises that any child who is 12 years old who sexually indulges is deemed to have done so with consent make sad reading. Currently, only children aged 16 are recognised as grown up and can indulge in sex as they choose. At this age girls or boys are recognised at law as indulging with consent. Currently any sex with someone under the age of 16 is a serious criminal offence for which someone can receive a stiff and deterrent sentence without the option of a fine. Now the latest move will mean the law will condone sexual relationships with a girl aged 12 since the girl would be deemed to have consented. One wonders on the maturity of a 12-year-old girl to be deemed as consenting to sexual intercourse unless society now wants to convert primary schools to sexually active havens where young girls sharpen their antics. This move must be re examined unless it has visible merits to share. -Masukume Nelson, Inyathi Centre, Bubi. Response to “Business, Church blast sanctions”. While naysayers among us continue to complain, Government is working silently to put in place the necessary pillars of economic recovery in order to improve people’s lives. When the opposition talks of the pie in the sky bail outs from Trump, Government is using the available resources to make a difference in people’s lives. – Nobleman Runyanga.
