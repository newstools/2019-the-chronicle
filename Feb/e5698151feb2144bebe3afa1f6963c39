AFTER being struck off from performing in Bulawayo at the Kalawa Homecoming party last year due to financial constraints, fans of South Africa music sensation Mlindo the Vocalist have been afforded another chance to watch him perform live in the city. The Amablesser hit-maker was supposed to be one of the headline acts alongside Sjava at the annual Homecoming Party in December which was later downsized to a club version. Now the man behind hits Amacala and Wamuhle is expected to perform at BAC Leisure in what has been dubbed the “Big Tent Experience with Mlindo”. The event will be held on February 23 with the artiste ably supported by Harare’s reggae/dancehall movement – Judgement Yard. The evergreen Zimdancehall crew and Mlindo are expected to rock the upmarket nightspot which has become the place to be for many revellers who appreciate the finer things in Bulawayo. Organisers of the show, 3D Events, through their founder Mduduzi Mdlongwa, said they were bringing Mlindo as he is popular among the ladies and is currently one of the most sought-after artistes in the neighbouring country. “Mlindo is a very popular artiste as a lot of people love his music, especially the ladies. Since it’s the month of love, we thought hosting him would suit the mood,” said Mdlongwa. He said the show had been dubbed the “Big Tent Experience” because they will be erecting a tent at the venue. “We’ll be putting a big tent as we want to accommodate as many fans and give them an experience that they’ll never forget.” Joining Mlindo will be 3D Family DJs, Champion Sounds and BAC resident DJs Kananjo, Slamma and Prince. Mdlongwa said fans who want to meet Mlindo exclusively can do so on the afternoon of the event at Hartsfield Tshisanyama. Advance tickets are set to go on sale next week with the cheapest ticket pegged at R100.
