UP-AND-COMING Gwanda house artiste Zhezhingtons is set to release his second album next month as he embarks on a journey to launch his career nationally. While he has no award to his name, Zhezhingtons was nominated twice for the 2017 and 2018 Skyz Metro FM Music Awards for his songs Siyagiya and Intombi. His music has received a fair share of airplay in the region but the artiste, through the forthcoming album, has his eyes set on penetrating the country. Born Fredrick Moyo, Zhezhingtons has vowed to make 2019 his breakthrough year. He said his new 10-track offering would be released next month and will feature producer and singer DJ Drumz as well as up-and-coming Gwanda artistes Khoi Khoi, Skolla, Pamz and Zagoe. His manager Admire Ndlovu said his rise was inevitable adding that they hope the album will play popular among fans. “The production of the album is complete and once all logistics are in order, the release should be done in the coming month. We hope our existing fans and new ones whom we’re targeting nationwide will enjoy it and help increase his fan base,” Ndlovu said. He said fans should brace themselves for a quality product that will certainly shake up the music industry. “The album will definitely take the industry by storm and I urge music lovers to rally behind Zhezhingtons as a local artiste and also continue giving other local artistes support that’ll enable them to grow and help our country’s music industry grow.” Zhezhingtons is one of the most sought-after artistes in Gwanda with the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) calling on his services frequently for most government functions in Matabeleland South. – @mthabisi_mthire.
