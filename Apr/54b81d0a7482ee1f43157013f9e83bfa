The Chronicle Sharon Buwerimwe, Chronicle Reporter TRANSPARENCY International Zimbabwe (TIZ) has urged the Government to adopt key strategic plans to curb corruption. Speaking at a National Anti-Corruption Strategy Validation workshop at Bulawayo Club last week, TIZ head of programmes Mr Farai Mutondoro said the Government does not have strategic plans to prevent corruption like other countries. “Zimbabwe does not have a policy or strategy that prevents corruption so we are campaigning for Government to put in place a framework of preventing corruption. To do that we conducted consultative workshops, radio programmes and dialogue sections with the main aim of producing a document that reflects Zimbabwe’s wishes and interests to fight corruption,” he said. Mr Mutondoro said for government to curb corruption, it should have strategic key plans which are Judiciary integrity, Public finance management, business integrity, empowered citizenry, Mining and Land sector governance. He said the government should revise the standardisation of timelines so that corruption is prevented. “The time frame to access key services is too much and people end up being corrupt, for instance when one wants to get a licence or visa, they are told to wait for a long period of time to get it,” Mr Mutondoro said. He said they would want to go to many provinces campaigning against corruption but they have limited resources. Bulawayo proportional representative MP Jasmine Toffa, who also attended the meeting, said the public needs to be educated through public hearings and media on how to curb corruption. “We need to get the public educated and people should attend public hearings so that they learn about corruption and know how to prevent it,” she said. – @sharonbuwe
