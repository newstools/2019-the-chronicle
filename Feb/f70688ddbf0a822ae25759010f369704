ELITE Tennis Village coach Zenzo Ndlovu conducted a three-day coaching clinic at Gwanda Seventh-day Adventist Primary School as part of Gwanda Tennis Club’s initiatives to popularise the game among learners. Dozens of children participated in the tournament, which Gwanda Tennis Club coach Mtshutshisi Mathema said was well attended by children and their parents from the community. “The event was successful considering we’re at the reviving stage where we’re trying to ensure tennis becomes one of the main sports in our area. I was happy with the way the children heeded the call to attend the coaching clinic to enhance their skills,” said Mathema. Selected Gwanda Tennis Club players played matches against participants from surrounding areas. “We’ve ensured that the courts are well taken care of and we will work tirelessly with the parents to ensure the youngsters stay on their toes,” Mathema said. He said the association had started engaging local schools to host more tennis events often.
