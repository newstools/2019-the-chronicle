The Chronicle Sukulwenkosi Dube-Matutu, Gwanda Correspondent POLICE have recovered 20 cattle stolen from Guyu area in Gwanda that were being driven by 10 suspects that ran away. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson, Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele said the stolen cattle were intercepted by community members from a neighbouring village while being driven through their area by the suspects on Saturday at around 2AM. “I can confirm that we intercepted 20 cattle that were stolen from Guyu area. A community member from Mnyabethi Village in Gwanda was asleep on Saturday at around 2AM when he heard the sound of cattle moving outside his homestead. He went outside to inquire and saw the cattle that were being driven by a group of people. “The villager alerted his neighbours who teamed up and intercepted the cattle. The 10 suspects who were driving the cattle fled from the scene upon realising that they had been caught leaving behind the cattle. The villagers then alerted the police who recovered the animals,” he said. Chief Insp Ndebele said the recovered cattle were all branded. He said the animals had since been identified by their owners. Chief Insp Ndebele said no arrests have been made so far and appealed to members of the public with information on the whereabouts of the suspects to contact the police. He commended community members from Mnyabethi Village for assisting police in recovering the stolen cattle. “As police we would like to thank the community of Mnyabethi for the great work they did in intercepting the stolen cattle. We would like to encourage other communities to copy this example and assist the police in any legal way possible to fight crime and apprehend suspects. “We always urge members of the public to get involved in community policing initiatives that we have set up as this will go a long way in fighting crime. We also urge people to desist from taking the law into their own hands when they intercept suspects,” he said.—@DubeMatutu
