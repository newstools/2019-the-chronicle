Clothing designer Nkanyeziyethu Malunga last month married her sweetheart, America-based Warriors footie star, Lucky Malala Mkosana at a wedding that took place at the Bulawayo City Council plantation (near Gwabalanda-Luveve). What was eye-catching about this particular nuptial was the traditional theme it exuded, topped off by one of Malunga’s wedding gowns that was made from Nguni cowhide. This gown was from her NkaZana collection. She rewrote the script of what a wedding is supposed to be as she decided to stay true to her roots, doing away with what most brides wear – long white dresses. The bridesmaids and groomsmen were all dressed in traditional wear which was designed by Malunga. Describing the wedding dress, Malunga said it had a long ixaba (cowhide showel) with white duchess satin which gave it a royal feel, matching head gear called isicholo. Her bouquet of feathers and wild flowers was housed in isihluzo (a traditional beer sieve). Even the confetti used to shower the couple after they tied the knot was uphoko (white sorghum) in line with the traditional theme. Malunga said she chose a traditional wedding theme so as to highlight the lifestyle the couple leads. <img class=" wp-image-431641" src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/royal-wedding-360x205.jpg" alt="" width="704" height="401" srcset="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/royal-wedding-360x205.jpg 360w, https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/royal-wedding.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /> Nkanyeziyethu Malunga and Lucky Malala Mkosana “We’re a cultural couple and wanted to celebrate our culture on our special day. We wanted to introduce a different way of celebrating a wedding through culture as I don’t subscribe to the western style of weddings having long white gowns. “I wanted a royal traditional wedding, plucked from a scene of the Tshaka Zulu era,” said Malunga. She said when she wore the gown and conceptualised the traditional wedding, she felt a great sense of pride. “There’s a huge sense of pride of wearing something cultural and being in touch with your roots. Since I design these outfits, it only made sense to wear them when I was tying the knot and stay true to my ethos as a traditional woman. “Also, my mother supported me in my decision to go traditional,” said Malunga. Having styled the groomsmen and the groom, Malunga said she was happy that her vision bore fruit on her wedding day. “When I styled the groom and groomsmen, I shared my vision of a traditional royal wedding with them. I clearly communicated to them that if you dress like royalty, then you become royalty and I’m glad they understood this as they looked royal on the day,” said Malunga. The designer who has showcased her works at events such as the Durban Fashion Fair and Intwasa Fashion Show said women should consult the right people when doing such traditional weddings. “People should consult people who’re relevant. Some consult people who don’t have a clue on traditional bridal wear or seek advice from the wrong people. They should look for someone who understands them and their vision.” On her meeting with Mkosana who plays for the Warriors, Malunga said the two started off as friends in high school until they decided to date in 2016. It did not take Mkosana years to realise that his best friend was the love of his life as he proposed to Malunga the same year, an occasion she remembers just like yesterday. “I remember I’d just lost my nephew and I was feeling low. He then suggested that we go for a vacation to Matopo Hills. When we got there, we went mountain hiking and as we got to the top, I met my sisters there and I was surprised. “There was also a photographer and I was told my sisters were there to do a photo shoot with me. As I was admiring the scenic view, he went on bended knee and proposed. Naturally I was shocked, but I accepted. The funny thing is all my sisters were in on it,” said Malunga.
