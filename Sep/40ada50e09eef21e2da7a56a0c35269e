The Chronicle Innocent Kurira, Sports Reporter THE Zifa Bulawayo Province Cup has been hailed as a resounding success and the association hopes next year’s tournament will be bigger and better. The tournament is for Division Two and Division Three teams in the province and the inaugural edition was contested by 32 teams. Bulawayo City developmental side lifted the Zifa Bulawayo Province Cup after beating Biya and Friends 2-1 at Luveve Stadium on Sunday. Biya and Friends is the brain child of former Highlanders and Warriors’ captain Thulani ‘‘Biya’’ Ncube and is coached by former AmaZulu left-back Goodson Gama. Zifa Bulawayo Province acting chairman Allan Mpofu said their inaugural tournament was a success. “The tournament went on very well. We all saw the huge crowd that came to watch the final on Sunday, which was very impressive. The support from everyone was just brilliant, there were one or two glitches we have to learn from and improve next year. Already the clubs and sponsors are calling for the tournament to be a season opener so that we do not have fixture congestion mid-season,” said Mpofu. – @innocentskizoe
