A 30-YEAR-OLD woman from Bulawayo who was part of a mob that allegedly broke into Bulateke Milling Company and stole mealie-meal, cash and various food stuffs worth about $40 000, has appeared in court. Siphiwe Sitima who resides in Pelandaba suburb and two other women who are on the run were part of the mob that broke into the milling company in Kelvin Light Industrial Site. Sitima yesterday appeared before Western Commonage magistrate Mr Stephen Ndlovu facing charges of unlawful entry and theft. She denied the allegations and was remanded in custody to Friday for trial. The prosecutor, Mr Tapiwa Solani, said on January 14, the trio was part of a mob that was breaking into shops. This happened during a violent three-day stay away called by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU). “Various food stuffs and cash were stolen including seven bags of 10 kilogrammes of mealie-meal that was found at Sitima’s house,” he said. Mr Masawo Jele, who was representing Bulateke Milling Company, testified. He said he was called by the police on January 15 telling him that there had been a break in at the milling company. “I was called by the police informing me about the break in that had happened. I proceeded to Bulateke and noticed that the mob used iron bars and rods to break in. Some food stuffs, cash and several bags of mealie-meal were missing and I filed a report,” Mr Jele said. Following investigations, Sitima was found in possession of some of the meal mealie worth $93, the court heard. — @LissahMangena
