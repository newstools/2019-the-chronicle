The Chronicle Descent Dube, Sports Reporter GLOBAL Athlete Performance Sports Academy’s Tanaka Mhlanga won the girls Under-10 competition at the Donga Francistown Tennis Tournament held in Botswana at the weekend. Mhlanga beat Bame Mankong of Botswana 6-3, 6-3 lift the singles title before teaming up with Kuzivaishe Chapepa to clinch the doubles. Mhlanga and Kuzivaishe were part of a four-member team that also included Kudzai Chapepa and Emmily Lebogang George, and accompanied by coach Thesly Mufunda. Mufunda said it is the club’s objective to see its players participating in regional tournaments so they can rub shoulders with players from different countries. “Tanaka was the winner in the Under-10 orange girls singles and runner-up doubles along with (Kuzivaishe). This was her first tournament outside Zimbabwe and her first Championship since she started playing tennis last year. Experience is the most important thing to gain in these tournaments as some of them who were doing it for the second time showed great composure,” said Mufunda. Under-10s have three levels; red stage, orange ball and green ball. After the green ball stage, they play the normal ball. He said it was unfortunate that Kudzai, who is one of the club’s best products, sustained an ankle injury after her first match and took no further part in the tournament. “The parents’ commitment is phenomenal and the kids keep pushing. Next stop is the Bulawayo Open on home soil and we’ll help the kids use the experience they got from Francistown event to give their all and walk away with positive results befitting their hard work,” said Mufunda.
