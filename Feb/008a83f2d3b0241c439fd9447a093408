A MONTH after the release of his first music album, Idlozi Lolaka, Madlela Skhobokhobo’s songs topped the charts on most local radio stations but little can be said of his second album Majazana. Over five months have passed since the release of the five-track album and none of the tracks seem to be standing out as was the case with his debut album that contained the popular Ngamnanka uSamaMoe. Known for his comedy antics, the new album is filled with comedy riding on a rhumba beat. Comprising the title track Majazana, Dawu, Sibande, Ukufa and Nathaniel, the album seems to be performing badly as none of the tracks are being played in kombis, bars and nightclubs as was the case with Ngamnanka. Ngamnanka uSaMamoe, the song which put Madlela on the Zimbabwean musical map, saw him scoop several awards, months after its release, a feat his fans had hoped the artiste would maintain. During the release of Majazana last year, Madlela vowed to sell over 20 000 copies but alas, that has not been the case as he has only sold a paltry 1 000 copies. In an interview however, Madlela said he was hoping for a change of events. “We have so far sold over 1 000 copies and still counting. We still stand with our target and hope that fans will embrace the album soon,” he said. Madlela says with time, Majazana will start bearing fruits as per his dream to grow more in the music circles. “I think my fans have welcomed the songs especially Majazana because we only measure the success during shows through the sing along by the fans.” It however, remains to be seen if Madlela will rise from this setback as he is set to release a new single with high-rising afro fusion musician Bajila in May. — @mthabisi_mthire.
