The Chronicle Ricky Zililo, Senior Sports Reporter REGISTRATION for the inaugural 3-on-3 basketball tournament to be held this weekend at Khanyisile Sports Centre in North End has now opened. Xolani Botha, a member of the tournament’s organising committee, said they are targeting 20 teams for the competition which is aimed at bringing excitement to basketball. “The concept to have this 3-on-3 competition came after we noted that the international basketball authority (FIBA) is moving towards introducing the 3-on-3 format of the game which is seen to be more fun than the traditional 5-on-5. “We’ve been playing social games and as a way of conscientising people about the exciting 3-on-3, we’ve been using it. “We decided to have this competition which is open to everyone. “Registration is $20 per team and it will close on the day of the tournament (Saturday),” said Botha. To spice up the event, in between matches there will be three-point shooter and slam dunk competitions, with the winner of each fun game getting $100. “We have an anonymous sponsor for this competition and are grateful for their support. We’re also grateful to Prestige Paints who have donated paint to spruce up the venue. “Besides fun games we’ve lined up, there’s a surprise prize for the crowd and the details of how to win the prize will be announced at the tournament. “So, this being a family event, we are calling on all basketball and sports enthusiasts to come for the tournament,” said Botha. Gate charges are $1 per person. — @ZililoR
