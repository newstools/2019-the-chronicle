The Chronicle Bongani Ndlovu, Showbiz Correspondent ORGANISERS of the Miss Tourism Bulawayo contest have decided to hold another round of auditions for aspiring models that missed the initial auditions two weeks ago. Miss Tourism Bulawayo licence holder, Nobesuthu Masango, said some models had missed the first auditions due to work commitments as they were held during the week on April 11 and 12. “We want to hold a second round of auditions because there are many models who called us saying they had missed the first ones. This was due to the fact that they (auditions) were held during the week and the models were at work,” Masango said. “We’ve taken their request into consideration and are now trying to hold other auditions next month. This time, we will hold them during the weekend so that we accommodate those who work and go to school.” She said the dates for the second round of auditions for Bulawayo will be announced soon. “We have two tentative dates, May 18 and May 25 but we’re still deliberating with my team. Once we’ve reached an agreement, we’ll advise the aspiring models.” Masango said they were happy with the turnout for the initial auditions where most aspirants made the cut. “The turnout was good. Bulawayo has great models, especially from universities. Most of the models made the cut while the rest who didn’t failed because of height and other issues,” she said. About 24 models will be shortlisted to compete for the Miss Tourism Bulawayo finale where about three will be chosen to represent the city at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe finals. Last year, 24-year-old Unisa law student, Anelisiwe Ndebele, was crowned Miss Tourism Bulawayo with former Miss Environment Sibusisiwe Falala being crowned first princess. Tendai Sibanda was crowned second princess. The three represented Bulawayo at the national finals but lost out to Manicaland’s Tafadzwa Jaricha who is also a lawyer.
