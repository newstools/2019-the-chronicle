SOUTH Africa-based sungura artiste, Ronnie “Vazvamburi” Mudhindo – a former Utakataka Express band member – says sungura music is slowly penetrating the South African music arena as people there are beginning to embrace it. The lanky bassist, who is now fronting Orchestra Vazvamburi, said it was quite encouraging as they can now hold live shows that are attended by diverse audiences, other than Zimbabweans based there. “We’ve joined forces as Zimbabweans here. I’m working with Sugar Sugar, Leonard Sithole, Kobiri and Lovemore Muzondiwa among other artistes and we’ve managed to create a brand that’s hard to ignore. “We’re holding shows and people here are starting to recognise our music and they seem to like it,” said Mudhindo. With the help of Sugar Sugar, Mudhindo said they have formed a formidable combination and are determined to take the sungura genre to another level in the neighbouring country. To show that he means business, Mudhindo has called on the help of South African artiste Freddy Gwala whom he wants to collaborate with. He said talks with the Amadamara hit-maker were at an advanced stage. “I can confirm that talks are at an advanced stage as we’re now trying to see how we can come up with a beat that’s suitable for both of us,” said Mudhindo.
