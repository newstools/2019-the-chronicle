THE director of economic crimes in the National Prosecuting Authority, Chief Law Officer Chris Mutangadura, has been transferred from Harare to Guruve with immediate effect, as part of an ongoing restructuring exercise. Mr Mutangadura was advised of his transfer by Prosecutor-General Kumbirai Hodzi on Thursday last week. In a letter addressed to Mr Mutangadura, PG Hodzi wrote: “You are hereby informed that with immediate effect you are transferred to Guruve National Prosecuting Authority Station. You will be taking instructions from there. “All your work to be properly handed over to the National Director of Public Prosecutions for further action.” In an interview yesterday, Mr Hodzi said the transfer was part of a restructuring exercise to enhance efficiency. He referred any other questions to NPA public relations officer, Mrs Angelina Munyeriwa. Efforts to get comment from Mrs Munyeriwa were fruitless. Last month, President Mnangagwa appointed Mr Hodzi as the country’s substantive Prosecutor-General. Mr Hodzi had been acting PG since July 24 last year and replaces Advocate Ray Goba who resigned mid last year. Prior to July 24, Mr Hodzi was deputy attorney-general in charge of the legal advice section since 2012. The office of the PG has become a hot seat, with two previous prosecutor-generals being fired for misconduct. Adv Goba was the third PG to leave office in recent times. The first to be removed from office was former Attorney-General Mr Sobusa Gula-Ndebele in May 2008, who doubled as head of criminal prosecution and civil litigation. He was fired for conducting himself in a manner inconsistent with public office. The dismissal followed recommendations by a tribunal which investigated him. Mr Gula-Ndebele was succeeded by Mr Johannes Tomana, who was also removed from office after a tribunal found him to be grossly incompetent in the execution of his duties.
