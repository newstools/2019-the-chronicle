The Chronicle Mejury Magaya, Midlands Reporter A 34-year-old Mberengwa vendor has been arrested for allegedly fatally assaulting her 15-year-old daughter with an axe handle and sticks for failing to surrender $7 she had received from a customer. Acting Midlands provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Ethel Mukwende confirmed the incident which occurred on November 28 at around 4.30PM at Dunning Farm in Mberengwa. “On November 27 around 4PM the deceased, Memory Shumba received $7 from one of her mother’s customers but did not hand over the cash. “The following day, Lydia Chenyika arrived home from work and found the now deceased and her younger sister preparing supper in the kitchen,” she said. Asst Insp Mukwende said Chenyika allegedly dragged the now deceased to a spare bedroom and started assaulting her with sticks multiple times all over her body accusing her of being dishonest. “Chenyika allegedly took a wooden axe handle and struck her daughter once on the head causing her to bleed profusely before she fetched a cowhide strop from the kitchen and further thrashed the deceased all over the body,” she said. Asst Insp Mukwende said Memory managed to escape from her mother. She said Chenyika didn’t pursue her. “The following day around 6AM Chenyika found Memory’s body in a bush about 100m from the homestead and carried the body home. The body had deep wounds on the swollen head and had bruises all over,” she said. Asst Insp Mukwende said Chenyika surrendered herself to the police and her daughter’s body was taken to Mberengwa District Hospital for post mortem. Asst Insp Mukwende urged parents and guardians not to use excessive force while disciplining their children. “We feel this incident was an act of cruelty and as the police we do not condone such acts of violence,” she said.
