THE World Anti Doping Agency (Wada)’s 2019 list of prohibited substances and methods which were first published in late September 2018, came into force on January 1. For a substance or method to be added to the list, it must be determined that it meets two of the following three criteria namely that it has the potential to enhance or enhances sport performance, it represents an actual or potential health risk to the athletes and it violates the spirit of sport The list, which is one of six international standards that are mandatory for all signatories of the World Anti-Doping Code, designates what substances and methods are prohibited both in- and out-of-competition, and which substances are banned in particular sports. The list’s annual revision is led by Wada, beginning with an initial meeting in January and concluding with the publication of the list by October 1. It is an extensive consultation process that includes Wada’s list expert group gathering information, circulating a draft list among stakeholders, taking their submissions into consideration and revising the draft, followed by review by the agency’s Health, Medical and Research committee. The HMR Committee then makes its recommendation to the Wada executive committee, which approves the list during its September meeting. However, athletes who have a legitimate medical reason for using a prohibited substance or method that is on the list, may be accommodated if they meet the criteria outlined in the international standards for therapeutic use exemptions (TUE). The TUE process has overwhelming acceptance from athletes, physicians and anti-doping stakeholders worldwide.
