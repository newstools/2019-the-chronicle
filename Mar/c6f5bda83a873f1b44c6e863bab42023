NEWLY promoted Southern Region Division One side Ajax Hotspurs FC director Siphambaniso Dube said the club is still looking for partnership as they prepare for the 2019 season due to start this month. The Division One fixtures have been released and Ajax Hotspurs are set to host Indlovu Iyanyathela in their opening game of the season. “The team has been practising since early January and I can safely say we are ready, but we need a partnership to ensure our season goes smoothly. We assembled a young squad that is hungry to challenge for honours,” said Dube. “The club’s objective is to provide a platform for youngsters to showcase their talent because everything done here at Ajax is focused on empowering young players. Now that the fixtures have been released, we will continue with our preparation and also work on finding a sponsor to partner us in any possible form,” he said. A well-wisher came to Ajax Hotspurs’ rescue by paying $1 480 in outstanding dues to the Zifa Bulawayo Province owed by the Mpopoma-based side. Ajax stormed into the Southern Region Division One League following an unbeaten run in the Second Division in which they won 20 games and drew 10. — @DecoDecent2
