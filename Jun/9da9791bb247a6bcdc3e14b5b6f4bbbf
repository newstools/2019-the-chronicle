The Chronicle Cape Town — Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United need to invest in youth instead of going for expensive marquee signings. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has a major rebuilding job on his hands at Old Trafford following a dismal 2018/19 campaign. The 13-time Premier League champions, who recruited Solskjaer after sacking Jose Mourinho in December, finished sixth and failed to qualify for the Champions League. “For Ole, I think the first thing he’s got to do is try and build the squad,” Rooney told BBC Radio Five Live’s Sportsweek programme. “I don’t think bringing one or two players in for over 100million is going to really help with the squad and the players who are there. “I think he needs to try and look at maybe five or six players who have got potential to be top players but you’re not spending £120 million, £130 million on these players. “I think you spend £30 million, £40 million and then try to improve them, which will also give you longevity out of the players and allow you to build a squad around the five or six new players that come in, plus a few of the players who are still there. “You could bring (Cristiano) Ronaldo, Sergio Ramos and (Lionel) Messi in, or Gareth Bale for instance, and it’s going to cost you £300 million, £350 million (for) which you’d get what? Maybe two years out of Ronaldo, a couple of years out of Ramos and then you’ve written that money off.” — Sport24.
