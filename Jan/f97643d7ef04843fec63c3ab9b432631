The President has promised to ensure that earnings value is restored as a matter of urgency. — Derick Tsimba. Strikes do not yield anything except making all parties suffer. For civil servants, dialogue is the way to go. — Betty Gatsi. Response to “Govt suspends duty on commodities”. This is a very commendable initiative by the Government. You have our full support.
