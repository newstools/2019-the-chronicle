GIRLS College (GC) Tennis Centre will no longer send a team to Bloemfontein, South Africa, for a tennis event scheduled for mid-March after Kudzai Chapepa was selected to represent Zimbabwe in the African Junior Open Championship. The African Junior Championship takes place in Bulawayo and clashes with the Bloemfontein tournament. Chapepa is among three Zimbabwean players selected to represent the country in the Under-12 category. GC Tennis Centre coach, Thesly Mufunda, said they were now focusing on helping 10-year-old Chapepa compete effectively in the international tournament. “After learning that she has been nominated to take part in the Junior Championships to be held in Bulawayo, we decided to turn down the invitation from South Africa due to the fact that the two events will be held in the same week,” said Mufunda. “The momentum is high and all our players have been attending training sessions and we’re pumped up following Chapepa’s success in Pretoria. She is now confident and knows how to deal with pressure. Between now and the date of the tournament, we want to ensure she gets as much competition as possible to help her adapt to work under pressure,” he said. Last month Chapepa won a silver medal at the Under-12 Belgrave Junior Tournament held in Groenkloof, Pretoria. – @DecoDecent2.
