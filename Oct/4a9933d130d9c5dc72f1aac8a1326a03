The Chronicle Nqobile Tshili, Chronicle Reporter A 13-YEAR-OLD boy connived with two other accomplices both under 20 years of age and allegedly killed an 82-year-old granny from Madlambuzi in Bulilima District, Matabeleland South after failing to get cash from her during a robbery. The incident occurred on Wednesday last week at about 11PM. Police identified the suspects as Mxolisi Nkomo (19), Trymore Nkomo (18) and the 13-year-old minor whose identity has been withheld for ethical reasons. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday said the trio went to the deceased’s house and strangled her when she said she did not have money that they had demanded. He said the granny’s body was found lying on the floor having bled from the nose with no visible injuries. Asst Comm Nyathi said the defenceless granny died in a painful way. “On 9 October 2019 at around 2300 hours, the accused persons; Mxolisi Nkomo (19), Trymore Nkomo (18) and (name withheld) acting in common purpose visited the deceased’s homestead armed with a one- metre long stick. They entered the victim’s house through the gate and proceeded to her bedroom where they gained entry through an unlocked door. “The trio demanded money from the victim who had none and they took turns to strangle her until she died,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi urged members of the public to respect the sanctity of human life as lives were being needlessly lost. “We want to warn perpetrators of this heinous crime that the long arm of the law will always catch up with them. Members of the public are advised to make sure that their houses are secured before retiring to bed,” he said. — @nqotshili
