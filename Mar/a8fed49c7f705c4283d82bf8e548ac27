The Chronicle Tadious Manyepo, Harare Bureau ZIFA Medical Committee chairman, Edward Chagonda, has made a passionate plea for professional footballers in the country to shun doping and other habits that derail their careers. Chagonda was speaking on the sidelines of an inaugural Premier Soccer League teams’ doctors and physiotherapists indaba in Harare yesterday. The workshop was held to bring the top-flight’s medical teams in sync with modern sport medicine trends for the well-being of players. With random doping tests set to be introduced in the Premiership starting this season, Chagonda said it was important for top-flight teams to educate their players on the dangers associated with taking prohibited substances. “Basically, we set down with PSL club doctors and physiotherapists to discuss about doping in general and the trends in management of match-related illnesses and injuries,’’ said Chagonda. “We are not looking at a player on the field of play alone but also at a player off the field as well. “The club doctors should understand what doping is all about. “We want to educate the doctors who are dealing with the players first. “We would like to inform PSL clubs doctors that players can sometimes be attended by another doctor who is not trained in anti-doping. ‘’So, it is the duty of the club’s doctor to inform the colleague how much of an impact the substance can affect the playing capacity of the player. “We don’t want to have a situation whereby a player gets banned from playing due to doping. “Any player who is playing professional football should never take any substance or drug without consulting their doctor because they could ruin their career.” PSL media liaison officer Kudzai Bare said medical workshops will be held. She confirmed doping tests will be introduced in the league this season.
